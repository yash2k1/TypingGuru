    "Topic1": "RBI’s monetary policy committee yesterday voted for a sixth increase in the policy interest rate, repo, in nine months. Repo was increased by 0.25 percentage points to 6.5%. But two of the six members in MPC voted against an increase. They were right – the underlying data on inflation and economic growth didn’t make a persuasive case for another hike in repo, which was 4% in the beginning of May 2022. Hardening interest rates mean costlier loans. If the root cause of inflation is excess demand, tightening monetary policy through higher rates will bring down the price level without harming production and investment. If supply disruptions are the main cause of inflation, raising interest rates is not necessarily the best course. In May 2022, RBI did have a case to raise repo because of the danger of inflation’s second-round effects. Food and fuel make up 55% of the consumer price index. As households feel the impact of changes in these items immediately, RBI was legitimately worried about inflation becoming generalised following energy price spikes. But it’s very likely that the fiscal action of freezing retail pump prices played a bigger role in keeping a lid on inflation. MPC’s statement yesterday made two important points on the growth-inflation dynamics. Both economic growth and inflation will slow down in 2023-24. MPC also said that core inflation pressures are high. With RBI’s GDP forecast for 2023-24 at 6.4% and annual average inflation at 5.3%, neither is the economy overheating nor is RBI unlikely to meet its legal inflation mandate. Elevated core inflation presents a different challenge. Core inflation appears unhinged from both repo level and economic growth. It’s been trending upwards since September 2019. In 2020-21, when the economy contracted, the annual CPI average was 6.2%. Very likely, multiple supply chain disruptions over the last three years have weakened the link between interest rates and core inflation. Research by SBI shows that core inflation in goods is far more volatile than services and has been the main cause for overall core inflation to be elevated. India’s manufacturing is not insulated from global supply chain disruptions and commodity price spikes. Moreover, the preceding five repo hikes in nine months are still working their way through the commercial system. These factors called for a pause in repo rate increase. RBI’s monetary policy committee increased its key interest rate, repo, for the sixth time in nine months to 6.5%. On this occasion, the rate of increase was 0.25 percentage points, lower than the last five occasions. The MPC’s decision was split in a 4:2 verdict, with two external members opting to avoid an increase in the interest rate. They were right. It’s hard to justify the MPC’s decision when it’s compared to the underlying data. An increase in interest rate is expected to curb total demand as loans become costlier. It’s an ideal tool if inflation is being caused by excess demand. In that case, higher interest rates pull back the extra demand without affecting production and supply. The data RBI and the union government churn out suggests that India does not have a problem of excess demand. It’s disruptions in supply and geopolitical tensions which are not in RBI’s control that are leading to higher inflation. Take the most important indicator of overall economic performance, GDP. RBI’s forecast for the next financial year, 2023-24, is that GDP growth will slow down from around 7% to 6.4%. In other words, we are not going to face a situation where the economy will face excess demand. If anything, the decelerating pace of economic growth is likely to be the main concern. Yet, inflation remains high and RBI thinks it will average 6.5% in 2022-23. The key question is what’s driving this inflation? Breaking down the inflation data over the last few years into food and fuel, which are not in RBI’s control, and core inflation, there’s a disturbing picture that emerges. Core inflation, which is more amenable to RBI control, has been trending upwards since September 2019. It’s been elevated for over a year now and MPC’s monetary policy statement acknowledged it. Very likely, the series of global disruptions in the last three years, Covid-19 and war in Europe, have led to supply chain disruptions that haven’t yet been fully overcome. Therefore, supply side problems rather than excess demand have been driving inflation. Increasing interest rates now are not ideal way to handle it. Keep in mind every increase in RBI’s policy interest rate takes time to work through the entire commercial system. The earlier increases in interest rate are still working their way through the system. Given these factors, MPC should have avoided another increase in interest rate today. It’s unlikely to influence core inflation in the near future. But it will have a negative impact on economy-wide demand.",
    "Topic2": "Upon resuming this week, the budget session of Parliament has sort of emulated a pacy action film, complete with the lead players sporting eye-catching costumes. Both the government and opposition aisles have been packed when either side has been in high rhetorical flow. What the opposition lacks in numbers it has tried to make up in decibels and togetherness, especially in sloganeering for a JPC probe into the Adani group. Treasury benches for their part talked past these cries, putting out long lists of “achievements”. Unsurprisingly, when one sifts through all this TRP-friendly play, no real insight is to be found. Even otherwise, an Rs 45 trillion Union Budget for a year with challenging global winds, has seen scarce discussion about how it will address the country’s various urgent needs. As usual PM Modi offered an aggressive defence of his government both in response to the motion of thanks on the President’s address and opposition charges. More unusually, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi served up matching aggression. His intervention showed the Bharat Jodo Yatra effect. Yet despite being focussed on the Adani issue, his attack was high on allegations and low on specifics. That looseness helped the government dismiss the attack as politicking. Indeed, and as our columnist today points out, both BJP and Congress leaders have shown, in and outside Parliament, that 30-plus years after reform, blind business bashing is still a favourite political ploy. This takes us to how the overall paucity of informative interventions in Parliament is less accident and more design. Speeches are almost in campaign style. With nine state elections lined up this year, and Lok Sabha elections next year, parliamentarians are in primetime TV mode. This is also a reminder that mathematical analysis of the legislature’s productivity, say by the number of sittings or hours of discussion, can be misleading. If the government is stingy with information, and opposition is ineffective at getting the information out of it, no amount of spectacle is any compensation. There are other questions. No doubt, there is symbolic value to expunging portions of speeches from parliamentary records, and those expunged have the right to protest. But in the age of live telecasts and social media, the ‘ban’ will only gain those speeches new audiences every day. The question is, what is Parliament serving up to its audience? Less and less informed and informative debate. Last week’s budget highlighted millets as a focus area for GoI, with the aim of making India a global hub for it. It’s a smart idea because increasing the production and domestic consumption of millets makes sense from the perspectives of nutrition and environment – and more exports are always welcome. But as a report in this paper showed, in the 2022-23 rabi crop season, millet acreage had declined by 5% in relation to a five-year average even though the overall farm acreage increased by 14% to 72.1 million hectares. This disconnect is no surprise. In 2013, GoI launched a crop diversification programme to shift acreage away from paddy in the original Green Revolution regions, Punjab, Haryana and western UP. Later, the Haryana government even offered a cash subsidy of Rs 7,000/acre to shift cultivation to alternate crops. None of these policies worked. If anything, the dominance of rice and wheat in India’s cereal basket is even more pronounced now. For example, between 2010-11 and 2020-21, acreage under coarse cereals declined by about 15% to 24.12 million hectares. In terms of output, coarse cereals made up 18% of the overall cereal output of 285.28 million tonnes in 2020-21. Further, in GoI’s gigantic, subsidised food distribution system, coarse cereals are barely present. Therefore, in what’s the world’s largest food security scheme covering about 800 million people, rice and wheat are an overwhelming presence. These numbers feed back into the economic incentives influencing farmers. The procurement system that supports the food distribution programme caters mainly to rice and wheat. As the procurement guarantees a floor price, an increasing number of farmers have an economic incentive to stick to these two cereals regardless of the long-term consequences. Unless this challenge is addressed, there will be a huge mismatch between the intent to transition towards millets. Therefore, to realize the goal of popularising millets, GoI has to start with providing the right economic incentives to farmers. The procurement system is the best location to begin the shift away from rice and wheat to the more nutrient-dense millets. Farmers, like other economic agents, respond to incentives.",
    "Topic3": "Almost nine years ago, Parliament passed legislation to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh. It said that Hyderabad will be the common capital of the successor states, Telangana and Andhra, for a decade. Subsequently, there will be a new capital for Andhra. Post-bifurcation, the Andhra government moved fast. In April 2015, it passed an order notifying Amaravati as capital. A new capital city was to be built. However, almost eight years later there’s uncertainty surrounding Amaravati’s status. Will it continue to be the capital or just one of three? The confusion embodies the state’s broken politics. YSR Congress Party’s success in the 2019 assembly elections changed things. In 2020, the assembly approved a bill that allowed for a transition from one capital to three seats of governance. Amaravati would be the legislative capital, Visakhapatnam the executive capital and Kurnool the judicial capital. This led to protests from some farmers and the matter reached the high court of Andhra. Meanwhile, in 2021 the YSR government repealed its own law on creating three seats of governance. The next year, the HC decided the Andhra government should stick to its original Amaravati plan. The state government took the matter to the apex court. The confusion over the capital represents wasted opportunities in the state and has had a negative impact on the investment climate. Dysfunctional politics, not unique to Andhra, has led to disputes and judicial intervention. The Supreme Court, which stayed the HC verdict, will resume hearing the case later this month while Visakhapatnam will soon host an investor’s summit. CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has already declared it will be the capital “in the days to come”. Hopefully, SC will help end the confusion and Andhra can finally put the matter to rest. The questionable elevation of advocate L. Victoria Gowri as a judge of the Madras High Court epitomises the problematic nature of the system of judicial appointment. It also portends a government-driven project to take over the Bench through its favourites. Ms. Gowri, whose unabashed prejudice against minorities became evident when her past speeches and interviews came to light after her name was approved by the Supreme Court, was sworn in at an oath-taking ceremony organised with great dispatch. Earlier, the Union Law Ministry had processed the recommendation concerning a set of candidates with extraordinary speed not displayed in other cases. It was clear that the government wanted to act ahead of any possible interim order from the Court, which had agreed to hear petitions from a group of lawyers against her appointment. In the process, the government ignored a specific recommendation that R. John Sathyan, an advocate whose candidature was earlier opposed by the Ministry, be appointed first. It is a clear message that the present regime would pick and choose among those approved by the collegium, in a manner informed by its political preferences. That the government repeatedly has its way indicates that the conflict over the appointment process has reached a stage in which the collegium is constantly under pressure to yield to the executive’s position on individuals if any meaningful progress is to be made on the perennial process of filling up vacancies. The challenge to Ms. Gowri’s appointment was on the ground that had there been effective consultation and relevant information placed before the collegium, her appointment may not have materialised. Further, by her speeches denouncing Christians and Muslims she had rendered herself ineligible to act without fear or favour; and that she could not be expected to dispense justice without discrimination “on the ground of religion”. However, the Bench rightly rejected the petitions, observing that it cannot revisit the suitability of any appointee after the collegium had decided on it. The Court on the judicial side could not possibly have gone into a choice made by its top three judges. Indeed, it made no sense to refer the collegium’s decision to a Bench for review. It is apparent that the State government too had not flagged her extreme views. While political affiliation should not disqualify anyone from judicial office, open bigotry ought to. It is also a signal failure of the collegium process that a controversial proposal could get past its scrutiny. What is needed is more than reform in the appointment system: perhaps, a process that combines an objective evaluation of the candidates’ credentials with an independent mechanism that ensures public scrutiny of their suitability. What is in place at present is an opaque, closed-door consensus-building that could leave room for unhealthy compromises.",      
    "Topic4": "After the IMF review mission rejected Pakistan’s debt management plan and asked it to steeply increase electricity tariff to restrict subsidies, PM Shehbaz Sharif indicated he had no choice but to implement the harsh conditions. Pakistan is in the midst of a deep forex crisis with reserves down to just $3.09 billion as of January 27. This can cover only 18 days of imports. Thus, Islamabad desperately needs to complete the pending ninth review under IMF’s $7 billion extended fund facility to stave off default.  But Pakistan’s power sector, long a quagmire of unsustainable subsidies, poor transmission and lack of accountability, is posing a problem. For the source of the woes, many point to the mismanaged privatisation exercise that led to the creation of 12 local distribution companies that mostly provided employment to military retirees. Meanwhile, a 2020 study flags the Pakistani government paying more than Pakistani Rs 1 trillion as Tariff Differential Subsidy where a uniform tariff is applied across all electrical distribution companies despite differences in cost, and the gap in revenue is financed by government. Add to this Islamabad’s policies like the Pakistani Rs 120 billion energy subsidy to exporters announced four months ago. If Islamabad is unable to get itself out of this economic hole, it would of course have catastrophic consequences for Pakistani people. But India should be concerned too. A total collapse of the Pakistani government – which is also facing a new spate of homegrown terrorism – could see the entire stretch from the Iran-Afghanistan border to Lahore becoming an extremist hotbed. This would certainly complicate India’s security challenges and lead to an even greater Al-Pak problem than the one the world has faced. Major countries must be on guard against such a disaster. Nirmala Sitharaman will tomorrow present this government’s penultimate budget – in the looming shadow of yet another global economic slowdown and consequent uncertainty. The last three budgets had most of their underlying assumptions knocked out by the outbreak of Covid and then conflict in Europe. Notwithstanding these shocks, India’s done well to keep its macroeconomic parameters under control. Against this backdrop, the budget should ensure consolidation of positive aspects while calibrating spending and taxation policies to support economic growth. Gross tax revenue in all likelihood will exceed the last budget’s targets. A surge in inflation last year has led to a forecast of nominal GDP growth of 15.4% in 2022-23 against the last budget’s expectation of 11.1%. Consequently, tax collection in 2022-23 is likely to overshoot the budget’s estimate of Rs 27.6 lakh crore. This should keep the fiscal defict/GDP ratio around the budget estimate of 6.4%. In the last few years, an adverse global environment has led to India’s fiscal deficit/GDP ratio shooting up, which pushed the debt to GDP percentage of all levels of government beyond 80%. Interest payment on debt, the largest source of GoI’s expenditure, is projected to increase 16% to Rs 9.40 lakh crore in the current financial year. A credible plan of fiscal consolidation is essential to bring down the GDP/debt ratio. It will lower interest outgo and create more space for development spending. In the current economic situation, enhanced capital expenditure will have a positive impact on India’s development. On average, GoI and states together contribute 11% of India’s annual fixed investment. However, in a year marked by uncertainty, public investment has to lead the way with a relatively larger share. Enhancing capital expenditure will lead to a positive spillover on economic growth and tax collections. Two trends stand out in GoI’s tax profile. Uncertain economic conditions have led to using indirect taxes such as fuel duties to stabilise revenue collection. It’s iniquitous. India’s tax side needs two changes. The expanding database through GST’s stabilisation needs to be leveraged to widen the direct tax base. What India needs is not higher tax rates, but a broader base that plugs exemptions. In this context, the alternative offered two years ago to individual taxpayers needs to be calibrated to make it more meaningful for salaried employees. They too need a less burdensome tax regime.",      
    "Topic5": "When the US-born, Bengaluru-based composer Ricky Kej won a Grammy this year for the best immersive audio album, he dedicated his award to India, no less. Any Indian, if they so choose, can bask in the glow of his success, feel like they own a bit of his talent and work, whether or not they’re familiar with it. Nobel-winner Venki Ramakrishnan had perhaps a different view, putting nationalist self-congratulation in perspective. He pointed out that science depends on the flow of ideas around the world, and narrow nationalism harms both science and the nation. They’re both fine attitudes, and a secure nation can take both. Besides, high as the nationalist pitch is globally, the link between place and homeland is messy, especially in our globalised times. Migrant workers pine for home, NRIs idealise it. Some people might relate more to a distant nation. Other people might feel unwanted in their own country. Recently, the Pakistani-origin singer Adnan Sami claimed that flying a Telugu flag contradicted the idea of being ‘Indian first’. But for most people, love for neighbourhood, country and other countries are like concentric circles. They can exist independent of each other, and in harmony. And there’s no one way to love your country. Those who can’t do public service can do lip service. Some even dodge their taxes and profess to love the country. Some demonstrate feelings for Bharat Mata through their shopping carts and stock portfolios. Cheering a cricket team or watching a Bollywood movie, painting a flag on one’s face or boosting a hashtag, no effort is too much for the nation. As long as loving one’s country doesn’t come with hating each other or any other country, it’s all for the better. So, thank you, Ricky Kej, the thought does count. The American shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon off the US coast has unsurprisingly further strained superpower relations. China’s response may be limited to angry words, but it’s unlikely to change its course. This wasn’t the first Chinese surveillance balloon to be detected but was the most sophisticated one. And reports are coming in of a second spy balloon flying over Central and South America. Therefore, there are important lessons here for countries like India that share a land border with China and have serious differences with Beijing. First, it is quite clear from the balloon incident that Chinese spy tech is getting increasingly sophisticated. Last year’s docking of a Chinese spy ship masquerading as a research vessel at Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port was another example of Beijing’s growing espionage capabilities. This time too Beijing insisted that the balloon flying over sensitive US military sites was a wayward weather-monitoring device. But its angry reaction after a US fighter jet shot down the balloon shows the craft wasn’t just studying wind patterns. Second, it is also increasingly clear that given China’s autocratic communist regime, distinctions between government and civilian assets are superficial. In fact, under Xi Jinping’s tenure at the helm of the party-state system, such civil-government and civil-military distinctions have further eroded. This puts vast civilian resources at Beijing’s disposal to carry out espionage, data collection and grey-zone tactics. Thus, all cooperation with Chinese civilian agencies and businesses needs to be seen in this light and appropriate safeguard worked out. China is using an all-of-government- and civil-society approach to spy on other countries. Another example of this was the 2020 investigation that revealed a Shenzhen-based technology firm was harvesting data on more than 10,000 influential individuals in India. Given this scenario, India needs to upgrade its hi-tech counter-espionage measures. Available information suggests India is quite behind in this game. Balloons, incidentally, have multiple uses outside espionage and weather, and therefore the incentives for becoming atmanirbhar in them is large. There is also an urgent need to step up counter-intelligence cooperation with the US and other likeminded democracies to counter China’s plans.",      
    "Topic6": "Nirmala Sitharaman’s fifth budget is her best yet. There are three standout features of Budget 2023-24. It’s economically smart, reflects political confidence and is fiscally credible. They are not discrete aspects of the budget. Rather, they blend seamlessly, which is what makes this also the best budget since 2014. India’s investment, or gross capital formation, as a proportion of GDP fell from 34.1% in the pre-pandemic year to 31.5% after its outbreak. Budgets since then have stepped in to keep investment high by enhancing effective capital expenditure. Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, it doubled to Rs 10.5 lakh crore. Yesterday’s budget increased effective capital expenditure by another 30% to Rs 13.7 lakh crore. Economically, it’s the best approach in the present context and it’s even resulted in the spending on transport exceeding the defence outlay. The smart economics underpinning the budget showed up in a significant personal income tax calibration. Based on the experience of a couple years, the new tax regime, which is based on negligible exemptions and lower rates, was tweaked. The changes make it more attractive for most taxpayers in the old regime to switch and save on tax outgo. In a year when global growth is expected to be slower, additional domestic consumption via the additional disposable income may offset the inevitable hit on exports. All budgets are situated in a political context. This budget exuded political confidence in two important ways. It’s the penultimate budget but it didn’t resort to unsustainable spending as a way to further electoral traction. In fact, it defied conventional wisdom by lowering the effective income tax rate for the rich by almost 4 percentage points to 39%. More important, lower taxes for the middle class, which BJP hasn’t overtly courted since 2014, show the party recognises that this group will grow bigger and play an increasingly important role in politics. The different strands of the budget will hold together only if there’s underlying fiscal credibility. The budget scores here even if its estimate of just 10.5% nominal GDP growth is too low. If the baseline GDP growth estimate is 6.5%, it’s hard to see how inflation this year will average just 4%. However, as the gross tax revenue growth is expected to be Rs 33.60 lakh crore in 2023-24, 10.4% higher than the revised estimate, a higher nominal GDP growth will also boost revenue receipts. In the absence of any external shock, the fiscal deficit estimate of 5.9% of GDP in 2023-24 should be met. The gradual glide path of deficit reduction is what was required. A minor letdown is the continued tinkering with import duties, although less this time. A general increase in import duties over four years is inconsistent with the emphasis on manufacturing. Also, budgetary concessions for specific products for a limited time typically lead to lobbying. A general downward revision in tariff to make manufacturing globally competitive is what ‘Make’ in India needs. That said, there’s little doubt this is the budget India needed at this juncture.",      
    "Topic7": "Almost a week after Hindenburg Research published a report questioning the group’s corporate governance standards, Adani Enterprises successfully closed its follow-on public offering of Rs 20,000 crore yesterday. Institutional investors and corporates led the buying while retail investors were unenthusiastic – the stock closed 4% lower than the floor price of the FPO. Hindenburg admittedly had an interest in Adani group securities as it had short sold them in overseas markets. Its report also said that its questions were posed vis-à-vis the valuation of Adani securities overseas. Yet it’s the reaction in India that indirectly poses questions to India’s regulators. Over three trading days till Monday, a total of Rs 5.56 lakh crore, or 29%, of the group’s market value in Indian stock exchanges was wiped out. For sure, Adani has replied to the Hindenburg report. That, however, did not reassure enough investors in India. Hindenburg’s modus operandi is not unusual in developed markets. Short sellers do raise inconvenient questions and at times push regulators to take action against some companies. As India’s large conglomerates tap funds from overseas markets by listing their securities there, they should be prepared for greater scrutiny from a variety of market participants. India Inc’s Western counterparts are not spared. Fluctuating share prices of listed Adani group companies have grabbed most attention. That’s a symptom, the real question is for India’s regulators. Listed companies have extensive compliance requirements. Yet the behaviour of Adani stocks suggested that not many take the compliance outcomes at face value. This can affect India’s economic potential because the inbuilt risk in a low-trust environment affects the cost of capital. Higher the cost, the more challenging it will be for companies to be competitive. Credible public regulators are good for the private sector. The day after Adani Enterprises decided not to go ahead with its fully subscribed follow-on public offer (FPO), its shares closed lower by 27% at Rs 1,565.30. It’s now around half the floor price of the FPO. In all, seven listed companies of the Adani group have lost more than $100 billion in market value since January 24. In the backdrop of these developments, India’s regulators and politicians swung into action. Parliament had to be adjourned over the issue. Separately, RBI has asked banks about their exposure to Adani firms, SEBI is also active and NSE has put some Adani firms under additional surveillance. Indian conglomerates now have both business and financial links with overseas markets. One of the lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis is that these links can show up in unexpected ways far from the epicentre of the crisis. Adani group firms have raised debt overseas. Over the last few days, the price of some of the debt securities has fallen sharply. Consequently, as media reports indicate, some of the Adani group debt securities are no longer accepted as collateral for trading. The fallout of such an environment will be felt by the group’s firms as it’s bound to affect both the flow of credit and its cost. There’s also the risk that negative perceptions may impact other Indian firms that have raised debt abroad. Conglomerates act as a link between different financial jurisdictions. Therefore, it’s unwise to assume that problems with Adani group’s overseas bonds won’t spill over to India. Spillovers across markets were a major aspect of the 2008 crisis – and American regulators were caught napping as money markets froze and then the panic spread across many types of financial markets in almost every geography. Indian regulators need to get on top of the Adani situation before election season politicking leads to unintended consequences. Panic undermines financial stability. The longer this plays out at a political level, the greater the risk of ill-conceived interventions to neutralise the fallout. The situation is as much a test of regulatory ability as it is of the future of the Adani group.",      
    "Topic8": "When the Taliban captured Kabul in August 2021, Imran Khan, then Prime Minister of Pakistan, said Afghanistan had “broken the shackles of slavery”. Pakistan, which had harboured the Taliban leadership, was largely seen as one of the victors of the Afghan civil war. But the celebratory mood faded as the Taliban’s triumph also emboldened the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani version of the Sunni Islamist insurgency. Since then, Pakistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan. Monday’s blast in a mosque in Peshawar’s highly fortified Police Line area, claiming at least 100 lives, was the deadliest in Pakistan in years and a sharp reminder of how its strategy of backing the “good Taliban” and fighting the “bad Taliban” has backfired. A TTP faction initially claimed responsibility, but a spokesperson denied any role. This demonstrates the divisions within the group rather than raising doubts about its involvement. The blast bears the hallmarks of a TTP attack — it took place in its stronghold and was targeted at security personnel. And no other group has claimed responsibility. The TTP and the Afghan Taliban may be organisationally different, but they are ideologically brothers. What the TTP wants to do in Pakistan is what the Taliban have managed to do in Afghanistan. After the 2014 Peshawar school bombing, which killed over 150 people, mostly children, the Pakistani Army had cracked down on the group. But the Afghan Taliban’s return to power changed the dynamics of insurgency in the border region. Mr. Khan adopted a policy of engagement towards the TTP. The Afghan Taliban hosted talks between the TTP and Pakistan which led to a ceasefire. But the year-long truce collapsed in November last year. Many believe that the TTP, which used the ceasefire to rearm and reorganise itself, is now spreading terror with greater firepower. The Peshawar blast has come at a time of continuing political instability, with Mr. Khan leading a relentless campaign against the government, Pakistan’s currency tanking, its foreign reserves falling, inflation soaring and the power situation remaining grim. Unable to pay its debts, the government is in talks with the IMF for a bailout package. And now, there is a security challenge. Pakistan should realise that its policy of selectively fighting and selectively harbouring terrorism and extremism has done it more harm than good. It needs a paradigm shift in its approach towards terrorism, while, more urgently, amassing its resources and going after the TTP, which is posing the biggest internal security threat to the Pakistani state. The government’s decision to issue notice to Pakistan, calling for negotiations to amend the Indus Waters Treaty, must be considered carefully. New Delhi says this extreme step is due to Pakistan’s intransigence over objections to two Indian hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir: the 330MW Kishanganga hydroelectric project (Jhelum) and the 850MW Ratle hydroelectric project (Chenab). India has argued since 2006, when the objections began, that the projects were within the treaty’s fair water use. However, Pakistan has refused to conclude negotiations with India in the bilateral mechanism — the Permanent Indus Commission of experts that meets regularly — and has often sought to escalate it. As a result, the World Bank appointed a neutral expert, but Pakistan pushed for the case to be heard at The Hague. India has objected to this sequencing, as it believes that each step should be fully exhausted before moving on to the next. While India was able to prevail over the World Bank to pause the process in 2016, Pakistan persisted, and since March 2022, the World Bank has agreed to have both a neutral expert and a Court of Arbitration (CoA) hear the arguments. India attended the hearings with the neutral expert last year, but has decided to boycott the CoA at The Hague that began its hearing on Friday. New Delhi says as talks have hit a dead-end, it wants the entire treaty to be opened up for amendments and renegotiations. India’s accusations against Pakistan may be valid, given that Islamabad has failed to provide material evidence of the two projects hampering its water supply. The World Bank’s decision to hold two parallel adjudication processes is also perilous as there could be contradictory rulings. However, opening up the treaty for review has its own problems that India must deliberate on with a cool mind. To begin with, the Indus Waters Treaty that decided the distribution of the six tributaries of the Indus or Sindhu between the two nations took nearly a decade to negotiate originally before its signing in 1960. Built in were mechanisms for coordination and dispute resolution that have held the treaty in good stead for at least half a century, and it has often been used as a template between upper riparian and lower riparian states worldwide. That it has endured despite conflict and political rhetoric between India and Pakistan is a testament to its text. In addition, if India and Pakistan have not been able to resolve issues over one case in their Indus Commission talks over 16 years, what guarantees are there that they can renegotiate the whole treaty within any reasonable time-frame? At a time when there is no political dialogue, trade and air or rail connectivity between them, reopening negotiations could open a new flank for India-Pakistan confrontation.",      
    "Topic9": "The Budget speech in the year preceding a general election is usually one that seeks to appease as wide a swathe of society as possible. It follows that ministries that fund the bulk of research and development (R&D) too would see a healthy jump in allocation. The Ministry of Science & Technology has received an allocation of ₹16,361.42 crore this year, on paper an impressive 15% increase from the previous estimate. However, between 2021-22 and 2022-23, the Ministry had seen a 3.9% decrease. The bulk of the hike has gone to the Department of Science and Technology (DST) — ₹7,931.05 crore, up 32.1% from last year. It was ₹2,683.86 crore for the Department of Biotechnology, or DBT (a nominal hike of 3.9%), and ₹5,746.51 crore (1.9%) for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). The Deep Ocean mission — which includes among other components developing a deep-submersible vehicle — and the National Research Foundation have got substantially higher hikes than in previous years, a sign that they are the Centre’s immediate focus. There were multiple references in the Budget speech for investing in dedicated centres for excellence in ‘Artificial intelligence’ research, initiatives to scale up technology to produce laboratory-made diamonds and a centre for research in sickle cell anaemia. While all of these efforts could be spread out across multiple arms of government, none of the budgetary allocations suggests a significant scale up of basic research. As with previous governments, this government too has not succeeded in increasing the percentage of spend on research and development to beyond 1% of GDP. While different countries define R&D spends variously, a rule of thumb suggests that developed and technologically advanced countries spend over 2% of their GDP on R&D, and India, according to a 2022 estimate by the Global Innovation Index, continues to hover around 0.7% despite being among the world’s largest producers of scientific literature. While funds are not the only challenge to research and development in India, the lack of significant raises across departments shows that the absorptive capacity of scientific institutions in the country is limited. A major challenge continues to be research scholars not getting promised funds on time and the wait for the quality equipment required by researchers, continuing to be mired in a maze of bureaucratic whimsy. The bulk of research continues to be funded by government and the participation of the private sector has grown only incrementally. In the next few years, the government must not only increase the size of the funding pie but also ease the procedures to make the most efficient use of it.  If budget making is a complex task, interpreting the Union Budget can be hazardous given the amount of fine print that one has to pore over. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s fifth Budget, and the current Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s final full-fledged one before next year’s general election, ticks all the right boxes on the face of it. Inclusive development that ensures prosperity for all, especially the youth, women, farmers, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, a focus on infrastructure and investment that serves as a multiplier for growth and employment, policies to enable green or environmentally sustainable growth, the rationalisation of direct taxes, including a raft of concessions to the middle and salaried classes, and pensioners, and, most importantly, doing all this while staying the course on fiscal consolidation. Terming it the “first Budget in Amrit Kaal”, Ms. Sitharaman sounded the poll bugle by emphasising the ruling dispensation’s achievements since 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first assumed office. Per capita income, she said, had more than doubled to ₹1.97 lakh as a result of the economy’s growth to being the worlds fifth-largest and the government’s efforts to ensure a better quality of living for all. She also cited an increase in formalisation of the economy and the widespread adoption of digital technologies, especially in the payments sphere, as other significant achievements. With an eye on ‘India at 100’, the Budget proposals, Ms. Sitharaman said, were aimed at actualising a “technology-driven and knowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust financial sector”. Emphasising that the economic agenda for achieving this vision would, among other things, require a focus on giving a strong impetus to growth and job creation, the Minister laid out her Budget proposals that were heavy on this government’s trademark acronyms describing the various schemes, but relatively light on details. PM VIKAS or Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma Kaushal Samman, for instance, would for the first time offer traditional artisans and craftspeople, or Vishwakarmas, a package of assistance aimed at helping them improve the quality, scale and reach of their products, she said. Specifics, including a financial outlay and the likely mechanics of implementation, were, however, not spelt out. Similarly, a ‘Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes’ or ‘MISHTI’, aimed at undertaking mangrove plantation along the coastline and on salt pan lands leaves the funding to a “convergence between MGNREGS and a compensatory afforestation fund”. With the rural sector’s mainstay employment guarantee scheme, one that was introduced during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government’s term, itself increasingly being starved of budgetary support, it is hard to fathom how the new initiative to protect and regenerate the ecologically sensitive mangroves will be funded. The decrease in outlay comes at a time when the rural economy is still to regain vigour from the ravages of the pandemic, the fallout on incomes from the uneven distribution of last year’s monsoon rainfall, and the relatively greater impact of high food inflation on hinterland households.",      
    "Topic10": "Jacinda Ardern’s time in office as New Zealand’s Prime Minister was rattled by several successive challenges. At 37, the Labour leader came to power in 2017, promising a “transformational change”. Nearly six years later when she leaves office, she would be better remembered for her handling of crises such as the coronavirus pandemic, the far-right terror attacks on mosques in Christchurch and volcanic eruptions. Ms. Ardern offered a leadership model rooted in empathy and moral values — the way she handled the Christchurch shootings is a case in point. Her approach towards the pandemic was initially popular, which helped Labour sweep the 2020 legislative elections. New Zealand’s per capita death rate from COVID-19 is among the lowest in the developed world. The way she announced her resignation also won her praise — that there is “not enough in the tank” for her to continue in the top office — which made her stand out in a world where not many leaders relinquish power easily. Chris Hipkins, a former Minister for COVID response in Ms. Ardern’s Cabinet and a troubleshooter for the Prime Minister, will succeed her and lead Labour in the 2023 election. While her leadership style is widely praised, particularly among liberal sections across the world, there are also questions on whether Ms. Ardern made good on the promises she made to the electorate. New Zealand is one of the most expensive countries to live in. In 2017, Ms. Ardern vowed to tackle the country’s housing crisis by constructing 1,00,000 homes, but only a fraction has been built in the past five years. Housing prices remain extensively high, while high inflation has left a hole in household budgets. Her promises to address child poverty (New Zealand has one of the worst rates of child poverty in the developed world) and tackle inequality (the top 10% control nearly half of the country’s household net worth) have fallen flat. Besides, continued lockdowns and COVID measures even when neighbouring Australia opened up turned a chunk of Ms. Ardern’s early admirers away from her. The slide in her popularity hit Labour’s election prospects which prompted many within the party to question her leadership. According to a December poll, Labour’s support stood at 33%, while 38% backed the centre-right National Party, the main opposition. It was against this background that Ms. Ardern announced her resignation. Mr. Hipkins now has only eight months to steady the ship and reverse the public mood, a tall ask. He should blend Ms. Ardern’s empathetic politics with a strong economic vision that would address New Zealand’s structural economic problems while keeping its social harmony intact.",      
    "Topic11": "The Supreme Court collegium has done well to push back against the Union government’s attempts to block the appointment of some advocates as High Court judges. The three-member collegium, which makes recommendations for High Court appointments, has reiterated its decision to elevate lawyers Saurabh Kirpal to the Delhi High Court, R. John Sathyan to the Madras High Court and Somasekhar Sundaresan to the Bombay High Court. As it dealt in detail with the objections raised by the Centre in each individual case, the motives behind the government’s ongoing contestation with the judiciary over appointments to constitutional courts stand exposed. Communications between the collegium and the Centre offer a glimpse into the untenable nature of the government’s objections to proposed appointees, making it abundantly clear how badly the current regime wants to control judicial appointments. If the objection based on a candidate’s sexual orientation smacks of a medieval-minded ideological bias, the effort to stall the elevation of a couple of advocates based on their social media activity exposes a mindset that sees appointments to the higher judiciary as a system of spoils meant for political loyalists. As the collegium has pointed out, neither the sexual orientation of Mr. Kirpal nor the airing of political views by the other two advocates will impinge on their suitability or integrity. The government appears to think that potential candidates for judicial appointments should not have political views of their own, or that a tendency to make their views or opinion known will amount to a possible bias in their functioning as judges. Nothing can disprove this more than the fact that there are other names — to which the government seems to have no objections — that are closely associated with political parties. Indeed, one can say that the history of judicial appointments is replete with instances of government law officers, who invariably enjoy the confidence of the political leadership at the Centre or the States, and lawyers who represent political leaders being offered positions on both the Supreme Court and High Court Benches. The objection based on sexual orientation is particularly appalling, as it is contrary to the constitutional position against discrimination based on sex or sexual preferences. The viewpoint that the collegium system of appointments is flawed as it is opaque and tends to reduce the zone of consideration is valid. However, the manner in which the current regime is seeking to filter out candidates who, it suspects, may not further its political agenda will surely give the impression that allowing any sort of government interference will pose a threat to judicial independence.",      
    "Topic12": "Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura in the northeastern region of India will elect new Assemblies in February. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s stakes are the highest as it seeks to retain power in Tripura and continue to be a key partner of the main ruling entities in the other two States. The BJP is in alliance with Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma’s National People’s Party (NPP) in Meghalaya and Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio’s Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) in Nagaland. The Congress, once the main party in the northeast, is struggling, wiped out in Nagaland, trying to stay afloat in Tripura, and raided by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Meghalaya. Regional parties in the northeast tend to align with the ruling party at the Centre, and the BJP has expanded its footprint in the region considerably in recent years. A BJP victory in 2018 ended more than two decades of Left Front rule in Tripura. However, being in power has not been easy; its first Chief Minister, Biplab Kumar Deb, was replaced with Manik Saha, a dental surgeon, in 2022, an effort to reverse the decline in the party’s popularity. The emergence of the Tipra Motha, a regional party that swept the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council polls in April 2021 has changed the dynamics in 20 Assembly seats in its area. A Left-Congress alliance is also possible. TMC leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been trying to gain a foothold in the northeast, but with limited success. In Meghalaya, 12 Congress MLAs defected to the TMC in 2021, but its stock has been depleting since. The TMC is viewed as a Bengali party in the State, where regional sentiments are strong. The party has some patches of influence in the Garo Hills of the State. In Nagaland, the BJP has announced a pre-poll alliance with its current partner the NDPP; in Meghalaya, the BJP and NPP are not only contesting separately but also calling each other names. Alliances in the State are usually forged after the elections. The NPP is facing accusations of corruption, and is being overly influenced by Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the BJP’s pointsman for the northeast. As usual, indigenous groups in Nagaland have threatened to boycott the polls, pressing various demands. A demand for the creation of Frontier Nagaland being raised by the Konyak Union, an apex tribal body is a new flavour of the season. The BJP is likely to continue with its innovations in dealing with regionalism while the Opposition’s capacity to sustain will be tested in these elections.",      
    "Topic13": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s latest Budget is noteworthy for the emphasis she has laid on the government’s commitment to move towards net-zero carbon emission by 2070. As an article presented at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos last month notes, India holds the key to hitting global climate change targets given its sizeable and growing energy needs. With the country’s population set to overtake China’s sometime this year, India’s appetite for energy to propel the economy is set to surge exponentially. The transition to green alternatives from the current reliance on fossil fuels is therefore an urgent imperative and an opportunity to leverage this move to catalyse new industries, generate jobs on a sizeable scale, and add to overall economic output. In a nod to this, Budget 2023-24 devoted a fair amount of space to the green industrial and economic transition needed. With the electric vehicle (EV) revolution poised to take off as every automobile major rolls out new EV models to tap demand, the availability of indigenously produced lithium-ion batteries has become a necessity, especially to lower the cost of EVs. The Budget hearteningly proposes to exempt customs duty on the import of capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium-ion cells used in EV batteries. This ought to give a fillip to local companies looking to set up EV battery plants. Another key proposal relates to the establishment of a viability gap funding mechanism to support the creation of battery energy storage systems with a capacity of 4,000 MWh. Energy storage systems are crucial in power grid stabilisation and essential as India increases its reliance on alternative sources of power generation including solar and wind. With wind turbine farms and solar photovoltaic projects characteristically producers of variable electric supply, battery storage systems become enablers of ensuring the electricity these generators produce at their peak output is stored and then supplied to match the demand arriving at the grid from household or industrial consumers. Ms. Sitharaman also set aside a vital ₹8,300 crore towards a ₹20,700 crore project for building an inter-State transmission system for the evacuation and grid integration of 13 GW of renewable energy from Ladakh. With its vast stretches of barren land and one of the country’s highest levels of sunlight availability, Ladakh is considered an ideal location to site photovoltaic arrays for producing a substantial capacity of solar power. The transmission line will help address what had so far been the hurdle in setting up solar capacity in the region, given its remoteness from India’s main power grid.",      
    "Topic14": "As India ramps up its international outreach in the year of its G-20 presidency, better ties with Canada are clearly on the agenda for the government, with the External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, hosting Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly for bilateral talks in New Delhi. This visit of Ms. Joly, who will be in Delhi again for the G-20 Foreign Minister’s Meeting in March, and later again to accompany Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the G-20 summit, will be followed by several other Ministers for other G-20 meetings. Another reason for the acceleration in relations is Canada’s deteriorating ties with China. In November, Canada announced its new Indo-Pacific Strategy that marked out China as an “increasingly disruptive global power”, while referring to India as a “critical partner” with shared traditions of democracy and pluralism. In addition, Canada’s search for new markets to diversify its considerable economic engagement with China coincides with India’s push to conclude free trade agreements with many countries. While officials have been working to announce an “Early Progress Trade Agreement” this year, they are also hopeful of securing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement soon. The flurry in bilateral activity is in contrast to past developments, especially after Mr. Trudeau’s disastrous India visit in 2018, and his criticism of the Modi government’s handling of the farmers’ agitation in 2020-21 that led to the cancellation of diplomatic activity. The ties began to be reset after he met Mr. Modi on the sidelines of the G-7 summit in Germany last year. Several issues remain to be sorted out — New Delhi has continued to express concerns over the resurgence of Khalistani separatism and calls for a “referendum” amid the Sikh community in Canada as well as incidents of vandalism and violence targeting the Indian community there. In addition, Canadian pronouncements on developments in India, including on rights and freedoms can always set off diplomatic landmines. This has been a running thread in bilateral ties, which have seen many ups and downs over the past decades, despite a massive Indian diaspora population and student links. Canada was among the first countries associated with India’s nuclear programme, but the relationship ruptured after India’s nuclear tests in 1974. When ties began to improve in the 1980s, it was Indian anger over Canadian shelter to separatist Khalistani groups behind the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight and the prolonged trial. Relations were restored in 2010, with the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Canada, and an agreement on civil nuclear cooperation, and Mr. Modi in 2015. But they flagged after 2018. This year, timing and intent seem on course for a leap in ties which could bring strategic and economic gains, provided both sides also focus on side-stepping the possible political pitfalls along the way.",      
    "Topic15": "The shooting down of a Chinese surveillance balloon by the U.S. military has served as a stark reminder of the deep distrust that characterises relations between the world’s two biggest powers. The detection of the balloon last week over Montana sparked a diplomatic crisis, leading to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling off a highly anticipated visit to China from February 6. The visit, which would have been the first by a top U.S. diplomat since 2018, was the result of a months-long effort to halt the downward spiral in ties, coming out of the Biden-Xi meet in November at the G-20 Bali summit. The fragility of that effort has been laid bare by the controversy over the balloon, which has punctured the process of restoring stability in relations that have been marred by growing discord. Beijing has maintained that the balloon was “civilian” (meteorology), but had drifted off-course. It also slammed the move to shoot it down as an overreaction. The U.S. has seen the deployment of what it called a surveillance balloon, on the eve of the Blinken visit, deep into its airspace as a grave provocation — one, it pointed out, that Beijing too would not have tolerated. U.S. officials have acknowledged this was by no means the first such surveillance balloon spotted over American skies; there was a similar incident under the Trump administration. Balloons were also spotted over Japan in 2020 and 2021, and over India’s Andaman Islands last year. All three governments did not take steps to shoot down the balloons, presumably coming to the conclusion that the balloons, in the age of intelligence powered by advanced satellites, were not important enough to warrant being shot down. New Delhi and Tokyo may now be prompted to reassess how they handle such intrusions in the future. Beijing, for its part, would do well to reconsider the benefits and costs of what appears to be a new, and provocative, tool for intelligence-gathering. It is conceivable that the Biden administration may have allowed the balloon to quietly drift away had it not been spotted in Montana. The Biden administration faced intense criticism at home for not shooting down the balloon earlier. Its response, including cancelling the Blinken visit, reflects how China has become a hot-button issue in U.S. politics. This development has constrained how a key relationship is managed. In 2001, the U.S. and China were able to dial down tensions after a collision between a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet over Hainan Island in China. Should a similar crisis now arise, particularly against the charged backdrop of an intensifying rivalry, muscle-flexing over Taiwan, and a heated domestic discourse, finding an off-ramp will be far more difficult.",      
    "Topic16": "No male player in recent history has probably used pain and disappointment as motivations for victory quite like Novak Djokovic. A year ago, the Serb was on a self-deceiving spiral, ejected from Australia — where he was a three-time defending champion — over his unvaccinated status. On Sunday, he did more than enough to banish those difficult memories by claiming a record-extending tenth Australian Open singles title (Open Era). The straight sets win over Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas also drew Djokovic level with Rafael Nadal’s tally of 22 Major trophies, the best among men. The triumph capped an incredible 12 months for Djokovic. In 2022, he was not allowed to compete in two of the four Grand Slam tournaments and four of the eight ATP Masters 1000s, and received no points for winning Wimbledon. Yet, he finished in the top-5, claiming a joint-best five titles (with Carlos Alcaraz). The successes earlier this month at the Adelaide International, and subsequently Melbourne, have brought him back to what has always seemed his rightful place — the pinnacle of ATP rankings, for a record 374th week. Barely four months shy of turning 36, Djokovic is at a stage where an athlete’s physical prowess — regardless of the indomitable will — is expected to enter the past tense. While this appears increasingly true of Nadal, Djokovic’s mask of invincibility looks firmly intact. On the women’s side, Aryna Sabalenka’s tennis was as picture perfect, as she secured her first Major title with a fine come-from-behind victory over Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina, also the reigning Wimbledon champion. Tipped for big things in 2021 when she reached the last four at Wimbledon and the US Open, and having finished the year ranked No.2, the heavy-hitting Belarusian has had to play much of the last 12 months against the sobering backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war and the emotional toll of having to compete as a neutral athlete. It was to the 24-year-old’s credit that she did not let any of this derail her pursuit of excellence, becoming only the second from her country after Victoria Azarenka — who made a stirring run to the semifinals before falling to Rybakina — to win a singles Major. A similar bolt by Sania Mirza in her last Slam appearance had the whole of India transfixed, until she fell agonisingly short of adding to her six Grand Slam crowns, losing the mixed doubles final with Rohan Bopanna. But the 36-year-old, who is set to retire at the WTA Dubai 1000 next month, will go down as one of India’s greatest sportspersons, a fearless competitor who inspired a generation, both on and off the court.",      
    "Topic17": "Germany’s connection with Bhubaneswar deepened last Sunday when the 2002 and 2006 champion won its third men’s Hockey World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium. Incidentally, Germany had claimed its last major title, the 2014 Champions Trophy, at Odisha’s capital — the modern part of the city which was designed by German architect Otto Konigsberger in 1946. The Die Honamas equalled Australia and the Netherlands’ triple crowns and remained one behind Pakistan. Germany, which had qualified for the World Cup by being runner-up in the Euro hockey championships and had lost to India in the Tokyo Olympics bronze medal match in 2021, was not among the favourites. It relied on its innate grit and resilience to script come-from-behind wins against England in the quarterfinals, the mighty Australia in the semifinals and 2018 edition’s champion Belgium in the final. Two of these, including the one in the summit clash, came through penalty shootouts. With a fine mix of promise and pedigree, also comprising seven players — including ‘Player of the final’ and ‘Best player’ and ‘Best Forward’ of the tournament Niklas Wellen — from the 2014 Champions Trophy winning side, Germany looked a cohesive unit. Drag-flicker Gonzalo Peillat, who played for Argentina in 2018, contributed significantly by scoring important goals in German colours. While Belgium’s dream of retaining its champion’s tag was shattered, Australia’s aim to win a record-equalling fourth gold received a setback as it returned empty handed after 1998. The Netherlands settled for a consolation bronze. The European nations’ domination continued but their Asian counterparts disappointed. South Korea, the best Asian side, took the eighth place. India, joint ninth with Argentina, recorded its lowest finish in the four World Cups it hosted. It resulted in the exit of chief coach Graham Reid, who had led India to a historic bronze medal in the Tokyo Olympics. Overall, the impeccably staged World Cup in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela, which boasts of the largest hockey stadium in terms of seating capacity, turned out to be a close affair with 11 of 44 matches either finishing as draws or going into shootouts. An average of 5.66 goals per match was the highest ever in a men’s World Cup. The successful conduct of the event, featuring packed houses for many games, has enhanced India’s reputation as an organizer of elite competitions and set a benchmark for Belgium and the Netherlands, the joint hosts of the 2026 men and women World Cups. At home, Hockey India, led by former captain Dilip Tirkey, should capitalise on the atmosphere created by this iconic event to rejuvenate the sport.",      
    "Topic18": "Two years after it captured power through a coup, Myanmar’s military is struggling to maintain its grip on power in a country that has become a land of many mutinies. On February 1, the second anniversary of the coup that toppled the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, thousands joined the opposition’s call for a “silent strike” by shutting shops and staying at home. The junta’s decision to extend the state of emergency — which would also mean that the August elections the Generals had announced seeking political legitimacy would be further delayed — points to the regime’s weakening control. This is certainly not the scenario Gen. Min Aung Hlaing had anticipated when he grabbed power, citing fraud in the 2020 general election which Ms. Suu Kyi’s party had swept. The Tatmadaw (the military) imprisoned the entire government and most of the ruling party lawmakers, including Ms. Suu Kyi, cracked down on democracy protests and started ruling the country directly — old tactics that have helped the Generals to rule through fear. But unlike in the past when the military faced democratic civilian resistance to its brutal rule, Myanmar fell into an armed civil war after the February coup. Whatever the military did to take control only made matters worse. Now the junta is facing multiple crises in the face of a humanitarian disaster. The remnants of the old government have formed an alternative administration, the National Unity Government. Several cells of the People’s Defence Force (PDF), the armed wing of the NUT, have sprung up in the otherwise peaceful Buddhist heartlands carrying out ambushes. In the borderlands, ethnic minority militias, which have been fighting the military, have joined hands with the urban guerillas of the PDF. The junta’s response has been indiscriminate bombings. Since the coup, some 3,000 civilians have been killed, 40,000 houses destroyed and about 1.5 million people displaced. According to the UN, some 17.6 million people, roughly a third of Myanmar’s population, will need humanitarian assistance. The junta is neither interested in nor capable of addressing these problems. And the war it is fighting against its own people is not helping the Generals’ cause either — a report by the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, an independent group of international experts, says the junta has stable control over only 17% of the country. This is an unprecedented scenario. What Myanmar urgently needs is meaningful dialogue between the junta and the opposition to restore democracy and start talks with ethnic rebels. Regional and international players, especially the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China and India, should push the Generals to start talks with the opposition.",      
    "Topic19": "India’s campaign in its second consecutive hockey World Cup at home had a dream start when local boy Amit Rohidas scored a brilliant goal in front of a packed house and the host beat Spain 2-0 at the spectacular new Birsa Munda Stadium in hockey hub Rourkela. Ten days later, the euphoria burst like a bubble as sixth-ranked India crumbled under pressure against 11th-placed New Zealand and lost the cross-over match via penalty shoot-outs to leave the capacity crowd at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar disheartened. Now India, which finished inside the top-eight in the three previous World Cups it hosted, will play for the ninth to 16th places. The premature exit of India — which had 13 players from the Tokyo Olympics and 14 from the 2018 World Cup (where it reached the quarterfinals) — proved to be a shocker especially as the team entered the World Cup as an Olympic medallist for the first time in over four decades. The post-mortem has begun and questions are being asked about a few past performers being left out of the squad. Even though picking players was a prerogative of those who were tasked with it, some flaws were glaringly obvious. Poor penalty corner conversion (five out of 26, primarily due to an off-colour drag-flicker and captain Harmanpreet Singh), a porous defensive structure, forwards’ below-par showing (four field goals in as many matches), losing ball possession in crucial moments and the overall lack of consistency in maintaining the intensity prevented the Graham Reid-coached side from achieving its potential. Nine goals from 94 circle entries and 49 shots on the goals was a telling statistic on India’s woes. Key midfielder Hardik Singh being ruled out due to an injury in the pool stage and ace goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh getting hurt during the shoot-out against New Zealand were big blows. Some experienced hands not getting a chance during the shoot-outs might have hampered India’s prospects too. India needs to do a reality check and address the issues quickly ahead of the Asian Games, which is an Olympic qualifying event, this year and the Paris Olympics in 2024. Even though India’s 48-year-old wait for a World Cup medal has become longer, Hockey India president and former India captain Dilip Tirkey, who has underlined the areas of concern, needs to take corrective steps to put the team back on track. Executing plans such as reviving the Hockey India League to give quality exposure to young Indian players and identifying a big pool of drag-flickers will contribute in lifting the standard of hockey.",      
    "Topic20": "When his predecessor Donald Trump’s home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, was raided last August and a trove of thousands of government documents was discovered there, including several hundreds of classified papers, little would U.S. President Joe Biden have imagined that he would find himself in a similar sticky situation. Yet, Mr. Biden and the White House have so far reacted calmly to the discovery of classified documents by his own attorneys at several sites including the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank in Washington, and in the garage and several other rooms of his home in Wilmington, Delaware. There are, of course, critical differences between the cases, which will probably be mirrored in varying legal consequences of each of the two classified leaks. First, the Trump stash is reported to be over 11,000, including about 300 marked classified or top secret, and includes photographs, whereas the papers associated with Mr. Biden are reportedly fewer than 12. Second, after Mr. Biden’s lawyers first discovered classified files in a locked closet at the think tank, his team voluntarily notified the National Archives and the Justice Department and are ‘cooperating with the investigation’ fully. In Mr. Trump’s case, after the U.S. National Archives found classified records to be missing and requested that Mr. Trump return them, he failed to comply and hence the matter was handed over to the FBI. Third, while both leaks are being investigated separately, the Justice Department is conducting a criminal inquiry into Mr. Trump’s handling of the documents, but in Mr. Biden’s case there is no indication of willful intent so far and he is protected by a rule that a sitting President cannot be indicted. Notwithstanding these facts, it is clear that Mr. Biden’s — or his teams — improper handling of classified material will cost him politically. Already, polls have found that his job approval rating, which enjoyed a bump towards the end of last year, has slumped back to around 40% — the all-time low of his presidency. The President is also facing difficult questions on why, after the initial discovery of the classified papers on November 2, his team suppressed that information until well after the November 8 midterm elections. Similarly, Republicans led by House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy have called for a Congressional investigation into the Biden classified leaks. The backlash could well be a setback for the case to prosecute Mr. Trump for violating the Espionage Act, even though he appears to have willfully taken the classified documents from their proper place of holding and then possibly obstructed justice when asked to return them.",

But the 36-year-old, who is set to retire at the WTA Dubai 1000 next month, will go down as one of India’s greatest sportspersons, a fearless competitor who inspired a generation, both on and off the court.",      
    "Topic22": "No male player in recent history has probably used pain and disappointment as motivations for victory quite like Novak Djokovic. A year ago, the Serb was on a self-deceiving spiral, ejected from Australia — where he was a three-time defending champion — over his unvaccinated status. On Sunday, he did more than enough to banish those difficult memories by claiming a record-extending tenth Australian Open singles title (Open Era). The straight sets win over Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas also drew Djokovic level with Rafael Nadal’s tally of 22 Major trophies, the best among men. The triumph capped an incredible 12 months for Djokovic. In 2022, he was not allowed to compete in two of the four Grand Slam tournaments and four of the eight ATP Masters 1000s, and received no points for winning Wimbledon. Yet, he finished in the top-5, claiming a joint-best five titles (with Carlos Alcaraz). The successes earlier this month at the Adelaide International, and subsequently Melbourne, have brought him back to what has always seemed his rightful place — the pinnacle of ATP rankings, for a record 374th week. Barely four months shy of turning 36, Djokovic is at a stage where an athlete’s physical prowess — regardless of the indomitable will — is expected to enter the past tense. While this appears increasingly true of Nadal, Djokovic’s mask of invincibility looks firmly intact. On the women’s side, Aryna Sabalenka’s tennis was as picture perfect, as she secured her first Major title with a fine come-from-behind victory over Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina, also the reigning Wimbledon champion. Tipped for big things in 2021 when she reached the last four at Wimbledon and the US Open, and having finished the year ranked No.2, the heavy-hitting Belarusian has had to play much of the last 12 months against the sobering backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war and the emotional toll of having to compete as a neutral athlete. It was to the 24-year-old’s credit that she did not let any of this derail her pursuit of excellence, becoming only the second from her country after Victoria Azarenka — who made a stirring run to the semifinals before falling to Rybakina — to win a singles Major. A similar bolt by Sania Mirza in her last Slam appearance had the whole of India transfixed, until she fell agonizingly short of adding to her six Grand Slam crowns, losing the mixed doubles final with Rohan Bopanna.

    "Topic23": "The aftermath of the release of a BBC documentary on the Gujarat pogrom of 2002, which questions the actions taken by the then Gujarat government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, can only be termed as yet another rendition of the ‘Streisand effect’. After issuing directions to disable access to the first episode on websites using emergency powers under the IT Rules, 2021 and Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) also blocked over 50 tweets with a link to the documentary. But this only resulted in citizens gaining access through screenings and shares over smartphones — akin to how the suppression of information has the unintended consequences of raising more awareness, or the ‘Streisand effect’. Other actions such as the police detention of 13 students at Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi, on the pretext that they were about to have a screening were an overkill and amounted to an abuse of power. It goes without saying that the government should not arbitrarily block the dissemination of media content just because it is critical of the regime. Its justification to use emergency powers to block access to the documentary, as being propagandist and of a colonial mindset, does not hold water if it is seen in the continuum of coverage of the pogrom and the aftermath. In any case, propaganda should be countered by propaganda, and not censorship. The events that led to the pogrom, the horrific crimes, the callousness of the then regime and the lack of sufficient recourse to law and order steps, have all been well recorded and commented upon in the Indian press. The BBC documentary is just another media investigation into a portion of India’s history that changed the course of the polity not just in Gujarat but also elsewhere. The online blocking of the first episode using emergency powers cannot be justified on the basis provided by the MIB that it is “propagandist”, and only reflects a recent tendency to utilise IT rules to assert executive power rather than address this as a free speech issue. The IT rules were amended in February 2021 to allow for increased government control over online news publications — actions that are now being heard in courts. Recent High Court orders have also weighed in on the need to protect free speech and have stayed the government’s moves to control freedom of expression on digital platforms. In its actions, a clear case can be made that the central government is more keen on blocking critical content than using the IT rules to regulate hate speech and misinformation — the true bane of the digital media ecosystem today.",      
    "Topic24": "Two mass shootings in 48 hours earlier this month in the U.S. State of California, claiming 18 lives, have been yet another grave reminder of the plague of gun violence confronting the world’s most powerful country. On January 21, in California’s Monterey Park, a gunman massacred 11 people in the country’s deadliest mass shooting so far this year. Two days later, seven people were killed in Half Moon Bay, in northern California. A few hours later, a shooting in Oakland resulted in one person being killed and seven others injured. “Tragedy upon tragedy,” was California Governor Gavin Newsom’s lament about the shootings. U.S. President Joe Biden, once again, called for a ban on assault weapons. Besides these statements, it is doubtful whether the U.S. Congress would pass any meaningful gun control laws. In January alone, there have been 38 shooting incidents in 17 different U.S. States. In the U.S., where the Second Amendment assures citizens of the right to bear arms, there are about 120 firearms for every 100 residents. Yet, despite repeated mass shootings, the U.S. still does not have strong national-level gun control laws. Every time a mass shooting takes place, Presidents issue strong statements and calls for legislative action, which fall on deaf ears. Last year, after an 18-year-old former student shot down 19 elementary schoolchildren in Uvalde, Texas, Congress passed the widest firearms legislation, the first in three decades, which expanded background checks for gun purchasers under 21 and imposed penalties on gun trafficking and straw purchases. Though widely welcomed, it was not enough to control gun violence in a country with the world’s largest per capita guns. The Supreme Court’s decision last year to strike down a New York State law that placed restrictions on carrying guns outside the home by reaffirming the Second Amendment was a setback for attempts to bring in strict State-wise legislation. House Democrats passed an assault weapons ban last year, but it never reached Mr. Biden’s desk as the Bill was stalled in the Senate. Republicans have often invoked constitutional rights to stall legislation. The deep-pocketed and influential National Rifle Association and the powerful gun manufacturing industry have consistently opposed gun control measures, despite polls showing a vast desire for stricter controls. Everyone knows what needs to be done — tougher gun controls. But it is surprising and tragic that a democracy that takes pride in its values and a superpower that has gone to wars in the name of protecting its citizens, seems helpless when it comes to doing what has to be done even when hundreds of Americans get killed every year due to gun violence.",      
    "Topic25": "There is nothing wrong, or that warrants grave concern, as claimed by Union Law Minister, Kiren Rijiju, in the Supreme Court Collegium disclosing portions of reports by intelligence agencies on prospective candidates for judicial appointments. If anything, the Collegium’s disclosure of the nature of the objections raised by the government has only helped make the discussion transparent. It is difficult to agree with the assumption that reports by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) on names recommended or considered by the Collegium are inherently sensitive in nature. RAW is cited in the Collegium’s disclosure as raising the issue of the suitability of an advocate for appointment because his partner is a foreign national. The IB reports appear to have highlighted social media posts by two other lawyers to raise doubts about their impartiality. While reiterating the earlier recommendations, the Collegium had to address the government’s objections on a point-by-point basis. There was nothing improper about the disclosure of the details, which were incidental to the purpose of rebutting the claims. In the three recent instances, there is no startling revelation in the intelligence reports concerning lawyers whose names have been recommended for appointment in different High Courts; nor is there any sensitive information that could compromise the identity of officers or their undercover work. It is not clear on what basis Mr. Rijiju has claimed that intelligence officers will “think twice” in future if their reports are made public, when only a summation of their reports is out in the public domain. In fact, it is questionable whether the government should quote intelligence reports in its communications with the Collegium. Objections based on political views or social media posts could have been raised by the government on its own, without citing any agency by name. It is part of the appointment process that names are vetted by intelligence agencies to look for possible criminal antecedents or misdemeanours, and raising such issues need not be specifically attributed to any agency. It is also quite rich that the government, which has been assailing the collegium system of appointments for its opaqueness, should be worried about excessive disclosure by the Collegium. It cannot be forgotten that the government is also contributing to the opaqueness by its silence and inaction regarding some recommendations, and demonstrating urgency in approving other names. It raises the question of suitability of some candidates based on some posts critical of government policy, but ignores the fact that lawyers with strong political affiliation to the ruling party also make it to the Bench without any impediment.",      
    "Topic26": "Even as India struggles to rise to the present challenges of improving school learning outcomes, a big new one is looming on the horizon. The ASER 2022 report indicating how much the pandemic pushed reading and math outcomes below already disquieting levels, has come amidst a global panic about how much ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence tool that can write college and school essays and solve some basic problems, will be upending education. For example, it’s been banned from New York City public schools’ devices and networks. Remember this chatbot was launched less than two months ago, more advanced versions and cousins will take exponentially faster tolls. Yet, most of India’s policymakers, school administrators and teachers maintain a loud silence on this topic. Their attitude makes zero sense given the breakneck pace at which the country has been embracing new technologies. It is also tone-deaf to the buzz among the students themselves. They are strikingly swifter at catching global cultural trends. The pull of a tool that can do the homework without the teacher detecting the plagiarism, is no different in Bengaluru than New York. Bans are a poor counter, with ChatGPT itself suggesting multiple ways of evading them. Much more sensible workarounds are also being devised, such as increased in-class, handwritten and creative assignments. ASER reports that across rural government and private schools, since 2018 the proportion of Class V children who can read at least a Class II text has fallen from 50.5% to 42.8%, while the number of Class V children who can do division has fallen from 27.9% to 25.6%. In theory it is possible that as deep learning is being deployed for mass admissions and testing, it can help guide more effective lesson plans. But this will need teachers with very sophisticated pedagogic and digital competency to be in the driving seat. Basically a new paradigm of foundational education is rising up in the world even as India is rallying the building blocks of the previous one. But our Achilles heel remains the same: poorly trained teachers. Herding them into a stadium to sit through lectures is a very poor substitute for ‘learning by doing’. Meanwhile, Bihar’s pupil-teacher ratio is a horrifying 54, 55 and 63 at the primary, secondary and higher secondary levels. Let’s equip our teachers better, then they can help turn AI from learning’s foe to friend. How do we make India a better place for women? Government schemes work slowly. What women need is a silver bullet that kills, or at least seriously wounds, the demon of discrimination. First, lower income tax rates for working women. When women pay lower income tax than men it will not only benefit women already in the workforce, it will also be a huge incentive for women who stay out of the workforce. Every male-dominated family that doesn’t want their daughter or their daughter-in-law to work will know that they are missing out on a good thing. Money often changes attitudes faster than morality does. Plus, there will be no long-term revenue loss here as the lower income tax rates for women will be more than offset by an expanding tax base from working women. The second set of incentives should be for parents who have daughters. Give parents a tax rebate for investments made in the name of daughters. Don’t put conditions on the kind of investment – that will be a dampener. Also, keep the lowest amount eligible for such tax rebate low, say, Rs 10,000, so that low-income households can participate. And put a ceiling on the highest amount, say, Rs 100,000, so that this scheme doesn’t distort investment decisions overall. Further, offer the rebate even when a girl reaches legal adulthood, so that women can also benefit. The attraction of getting a tax rebate will override patriarchal impulses. And over time, such a corpus will give women, even those who don’t work, a measure of financial independence. For older women, the accumulated money represents the chance of personal freedom. To make a difference, you must think different.",      
    "Topic27": "PM Modi added his voice to many other voices when calling for a repeal of obsolete criminal laws and prison reforms to improve jail management. Linking repeal of redundant criminal laws with prison reforms is an important step. To contextualise the issue, it makes sense to get an overview of India’s prisons and then link it to the existing legal framework. India’s jails are horribly overcrowded. They are packed with largely young inmates (18-30 years), most of whom are yet to be convicted. NCRB’s prison statistics for 2021 showed that the occupancy rate was 130%, a 12-percentage-point increase over the previous year. In two states, Uttarakhand and UP, the occupancy rate was as high as 185%. The overcrowding is because 77% of India’s 5.54 lakh prisoners are undertrials. In other words, three of four inmates have not even been convicted. As many as 11,490 prisoners had spent more than five years in jail without a conviction. The sorry state of India’s prisons has a lot to do with obsolete and irrational criminal laws. Consider three examples. Over 10% of the prison population in 2021 were undertrials for rape and dowry deaths. Both are heinous crimes that should lead to severe punishment. However, sexual assault laws do not differentiate between rape and false promises of marriage. Also, anti-dowry laws are framed in such a way that police can arrest multiple people for one crime. Plus, there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence that these laws are sometimes misused. About 25% of undertrials in 2021 were imprisoned under special and local laws – for crimes falling under the umbrella of liquor and narcotics. Prohibition laws are irrational and often lead to poorer citizens being jailed for long periods as India’s legal aid system is dysfunctional. There are other examples such as Section 292 of IPC, which was introduced during the British Raj to deal with obscenity, that have become tools to harass citizens. Another Raj-era obsolete criminal provision is the sedition law. Prison reforms in India cannot be brought about by constructing more jails. The core problem is that there are far too many unnecessary provisions in criminal laws that deprive many citizens of liberty. They need to be repealed. Once that happens, prison reforms will follow. The political executive at the Centre and in states should initiate these changes.",      
    "Topic28": "A technology incubation ecosystem in IIT-Madras has developed a mobile phone operating system (OS) with the help of GoI funding. Named BharOS, it represents an important milestone in India’s technological evolution. An OS is a software that runs the phone. BharOS is the second big attempt by GoI-funded scientists to crack open the OS market. Last time, BOSS GNU/Linux was developed by C-DAC for desktops. Developing an OS is an impressive achievement. But commercialising it is perhaps harder because of the business model driving Big Tech. Google’s Android OS, the dominant software among smartphones, runs more than 3 billion handsets. Most potential competitors such as BharOS are referred to as ‘Android Forks’ as they are modified versions of Android. The source code for Android is free which leads to development of forks. Though forks are a potential threat, they have not displaced Android because of the business model underpinning the rest of the OS ecosystem. An antitrust investigation by the European Commission explained why. In smartphones, application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow different software programmes to communicate, are of critical importance to app developers. Through its proprietary APIs and agreements with handset manufacturers, Google has made it very tough for fork developers to gain commercial viability. China was a notable exception even though its ecosystem developed on forks. However, when Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei went international, they had no alternative but to be a part of the Google ecosystem. Where does that leave BharOS? There are two things going for it. One, the capture of private data by the Android OS model, which has catalysed demand for alternatives. Two, strategic security needs require a parallel system. BharOS comes as a No Default Apps system which means preloading is not possible. It also has automatic updates, which weave in the latest security patches and bug fixes. At the moment, BharOS is targeting closed user groups and is working with government and strategic agencies. Its features suit these organisations as they require an OS which protects transmission of sensitive information. Commercialisation, however, may not achieve scale unless the regulators across the world find effective ways of prising open the OS ecosystem. That process has gathered momentum. For the moment, however, BharOS represents a milestone that can gain traction because of a large domestic market.",      
    "Topic29": "Yesterday’s R-Day parade had all the usual display of military hardware – with one difference, there was a fair number of India-manufactured weapons. Arjun MK-1 main battle tank, K-9 Vajra self-propelled howitzer, BrahMos and Nag missiles and choppers. India isn’t and should never be a nation-state that seeks war. But India’s neighbourhood isn’t a peaceful one. So, while seeking peace, it has to muscle up militarily, and indigenisation is the best way to do that. Having largely relied on foreign defence platforms over the years, the belated indigenisation push is certainly welcome. Roughly 60% of India’s defence hardware is of Russian origin. And the Ukraine war has thoroughly exposed this outdated ‘Potemkin arsenal’. GoI’s four positive indigenisation lists – more than 400 defence items that have to be procured domestically – are a good start. However, the country is still confronted with gaps in indigenous development capabilities for high-tech platforms. For example, even the import content for the indigenous Tejas fighter continues to be around 50%. Therefore, the focus now ought to be on increasing the level of indigenisation. That can happen only through ramping up the quality of R&D. This is where civilian and defence R&D can create a mutually reinforcing technology ecosystem. Many of the worlds widely used products and services have military-civilian dual applications. The internet, space rockets, GPS and radar are merely the most famous examples. Microwaves, canned food, duct tape, aviator sunglasses, synthetic rubber tyres, freeze-drying – and many more are results of defence-related research. Drones are the latest example of military research changing civilian life. Defence research has even had an enormous impact on healthcare. Blood transfusion, EpiPens and even the basic concept of ambulances originated in the needs of armed forces. India’s large defence needs and fiscal support for domestic weapons systems are a starting point. GoI must help create a network of big companies that can manufacture weapon systems and components, technology entrepreneurs who will experiment with new tech and IITs and the better universities that can provide talented young researchers and scientists. This is doable, if GoI thinks creatively.",      
    "Topic30": "Odisha government deserves full credit for hosting the Hockey World Cup for the second time in a row. The marquee event kicked off yesterday in the twin host cities of Bhubaneswar and Rourkela, the latter showcasing the new state-of-the-art Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium built at a cost of more than Rs 250 crore. It’s a fitting tribute to the cradle of Indian hockey. Sundargarh district where Rourkela is situated has produced more than 50 national hockey players including Lazarus Barla, Dilip Tirkey and Jyoti Kullu. If Indian hockey is to be revived to its former glory, Odisha will certainly play a key part. That revival could receive a fillip at this Cup as India for the first time enters the tournament as a current Olympic medalist. But the team’s Tokyo bronze will be put to serious test. India last won this tournament way back in 1975. The game changed dramatically over subsequent decades as the playing surface switched from grass to AstroTurf. Plus, a string of poor performances led to the shrinking of hockey’s fan base. Simultaneously, the rise of cricket eclipsed the national sport. But the Tokyo bronze has laid the platform for a resurgence. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh and his men have made a winning 2-0 start against Spain. A podium finish will iconize the current crop of players and attract more youngsters to the game. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik deserves special praise for sponsoring the men’s and women’s teams since 2018. It’s the faith of die-hard hockey fans that has kept the game alive in India. A World Cup medal will be a perfect finish. Indian women’s cricket had a great week. On Wednesday, BCCI announced the kick-off of a T20 Women’s Premier League with five city-based franchises sold for an aggregate Rs 4,670 crore. Later, on Friday, the Indian under-19 women’s team reached the final of the ongoing T20 World Cup in South Africa. T20 is cricket’s most commercially viable format. The absence of a WPL meant that Indian women’s cricket was short-changed as BCCI’s attention was focussed almost entirely on men’s cricket. The latent potential in women’s cricket was underlined by two aspects of the WPL auction. Three of the five successful bidders also run IPL teams. The auction also witnessed geographically dispersed bidding. Women’s cricket is not just a big city phenomenon – Dharamsala and Guwahati saw spirited bidding. Leveraging the commercial potential will provide a booster for women cricketers in much the same way as it did for men. It will now provide livelihood opportunities for a far bigger pool of players. The related spin-off will be more resources for the domestic structure. The combined effect will rub off on the international performances of the Indian women’s team. Indian women’s cricket has been always neglected, dependent on the benevolence of male administrators. With the advent of compelling economic reasons to promote women’s cricket, BCCI will no longer ignore it. WPL has the potential to transform the women’s game in India.",      
    "Topic31": "By agreeing to India’s proposal to create the Startup20 Engagement Group — the only new group — the Group of Twenty has turned itself into an ambidextrous institution, one where both large corporations and startups have an equal voice in taking the economies forward. In the new architecture, while the existing B20 Engagement Group continues its focus on corporations, the Startup20 takes on the policy issues concerning the global startup ecosystem, with the necessary linkages between the two groups. The proposition is simple: Just as nature has designed the animal kingdom such that animals who wish to exploit their full capability must develop both sets of limbs, can we design economies with the capability to exploit both the stability and scale of large corporations and the agility and innovativeness of smaller startups? It may be interesting to note that contemporary cultures have lost the emphasis on developing ambidexterity in individuals, which was once present when wars were fought between armies. For example, the ancient Greeks systematically developed ambidexterity in warriors by teaching them to be as proficient in fighting with their non-dominant limb as the dominant one. A measure of how deeply they must have believed in developing ambidexterity is evident from their language Boustrophedon, where the script read from right-to-left, and right-to-left on alternate lines. There is a similar emphasis in the Mahabharat. Arjun carries the epithet Savyasachi — one who is an equally capable archer with both arms, or simply, ambidextrous. In the present day and age, it is the arts and sports that contribute to developing ambidexterity.  In contemporary business literature, there is an active debate about ambidexterity, albeit limited to the capability of a single firm to simultaneously exploit what it is good at and explore new opportunities, despite limited resources. In contrast, the G20’s move to create Startup20 raises this argument to the level of nations, and collectively, the world. Since there is no theory of ambidexterity of institutions at the global level, let me propose a three-part one: First, most problems that matter to the world requires an entirely new solution paradigm than the ones we now deploy. Two, transitioning to such new paradigms will require innovating novel solutions and scaling them sustainably. Three, the quickest way to get there is to count on startups to innovate and corporates to scale them. Let’s apply this theory to healthcare, a topic of global interest. There would be hardly any disagreement about the need for a paradigm that is radically more inclusive, efficient and affordable compared to the one we are in. Consider the most pertinent issue of the day — access to Covid-19 vaccination. As per ourworldindata.org, a site maintained by Oxford University and quoted by the WHO in its World Health Statistics, 69.4 per cent of the world has received at least one vaccine dosage; this number is only 26.4 per cent for low-income countries (data accessed at 6 pm on February 11). This is not a new pattern. It is similar to any disease prevalent globally. The point is that even in the direst times, the challenge of equitable access to healthcare isn’t going to be solved automatically by the paradigm that gave rise to it. We need to rethink healthcare access.  What is interesting is that the rates of vaccination are not uniformly low across all low-and- middle-income countries. While countries like Burundi, Haiti and Madagascar have a single-digit percentage of their population vaccinated others like Vietnam, Samoa and Bangladesh have vaccination rates above 80 per cent — higher than the United States. Even in a large nation like India, over 70 per cent of people are vaccinated, which is a rate similar to much smaller and wealthier European nations. How did this happen? The India story is very clear: This was possible through a combination of frantic innovation and rapid scaling-up.  During the pandemic, innovations happened at many levels, but the most notable was the development of the vaccine itself. Before Covid, the world had never developed a vaccine in less than a decade. In the case of Covid-19, this happened in less than a year. Vaccine development was led worldwide by firms that worked like startups, regardless of how endowed they may have been. In India, Bharat Biotech developed Covaxin, while other leading vaccines came from Biontech, Moderna, and Oxford University. The innovations were later scaled up globally by innovators collaborating with large corporations, as was the case with Pfizer partnering with Biontech, or AstraZeneca with Oxford. Thus, we successfully leveraged ambidexterity during the pandemic. The question is: Do such patterns work in normal times? Indeed, but because they happen over longer time frames we don’t have the luxury of observing them easily. Take any sector that has changed significantly in your lifetime — for example, communications. As you went from landline phones to internet calling, who was innovating? It was upstarts like Skype and WhatsApp, just to name the dominant players. While the upstarts themselves scaled, who provided the access to internet calling at scale? It was the large corporations providing wired or wireless services. The ambidexterity was present, though as a market-led progression. Arguably, some of our toughest challenges such as containing the global temperature rise, and ensuring food and energy security cannot be addressed effectively without innovating at scale. Can we be more deliberate while leveraging global ambidexterity to solve such problems systematically? Well, if we deploy the G20’s new architecture of B20 and Startup20 well, we sure can!",      
    "Topic32": "On February 18, 1911, a 23-year-old Frenchman, Henri Pequet, flew the first official airmail flight over the Yamuna River. This 10-kilometre flight between Prayagraj (then Allahabad) and Naini was a part of the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition and started India’s unique tryst with commercial aviation. Today, India is the third largest domestic civil aviation market in the world after China and the US. Domestic passengers more than doubled from 60 million in 2014 to 143 million in 2020, prior to Covid-19. There has also been a significant increase in international air passengers — from 23 million to 35 million. Flying is no longer looked upon as an elitist luxury but a necessary service. India’s civil aviation sector has not only democratised air travel by adding crores of first-time fliers but it has also provided employment opportunities for engineers, trained technicians and airline service staff. Many private airlines have attempted to attract India’s large middle class into becoming commercial air travelers by offering no-frills, cost-effective services. Central to this strategy was to make flight operations to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities commercially viable. To accelerate this, in 2017, the Government of India approved a budget of Rs 4,500 crore for the revival of existing unserved and underserved airports and airstrips through the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS). Since then, UDAN — Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik — has expedited connectivity to non-metros. Left to private enterprise alone, connectivity to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in India would have taken a very long time. Today, approximately 475 UDAN routes involving 73 airports including nine heliports and two water aerodromes have been operationalised. About 75 routes, which is more than 15 per cent, connect the Northeast where terrain and other challenges require a robust air network. Since its inception, over 1.14 crore passengers have travelled in more than 2.16 Lakh UDAN flights and Rs 2,300 crore has been paid to selected airlines by the government as a part of the viability gap funding. As a result, the number of operational airports in India has almost doubled from 74 to 147 in the last eight years. Indian flight operators have a fleet size of approximately 750 aircraft. As flight operations in India continue to grow, the fleet size is expected to increase rapidly. To keep the aircraft airworthy, regular maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) is required. The growth in the country’s fleet size is positively correlated with the growth in MRO-related work. As per industry estimates, the market size of the MRO sector in India stood at around $2 billion, catering to 15 per cent of our domestic MRO work. The availability of a strong pool of English-speaking engineers at affordable rates gives India a natural advantage in increasing its share of MRO-related work.To capitalise on this, the government issued new MRO Guidelines to encourage MRO organisations and OEMs to set up workshops in India. The steps taken towards making India a global hub of MRO include 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment permitted via automatic route for MRO, a liberalised policy for borrowing and lending in foreign currency and Indian currency on competitive terms for MROs and reduction of GST from 18 per cent to 5 per cent with full Input Tax Credit. As the Indian fleet size grows, the need for flying staff including commercial pilots, transport pilots and others will increase. At 1,165 commercial pilot licences, 2022 saw the largest number of commercial pilot licences issued over the last decade. The need for pilots has also led to an increase in Flight Training organisations (FTOs). Currently, India has 35 approved FTOs with 53 bases and an additional 10 are on the anvil. Similarly, the number of Air Traffic Controllers has increased from a little over 2,000 in 2012 to close to 4,000 in 2022. Last year, the government issued guidelines for Production Linked Incentives (PLI) for drones with an outlay of Rs 120 crore over three years. The target segment contains drones and drone components. Coupled with this there has been a massive liberalisation of the drone policy under which 25 forms have been reduced to just five. Further, 72 types of fees have been reduced to four and approximately 90 per cent of airspace has been marked as ‘Green’ under which no permission is required to operate drones. Another area where civil aviation policy has contributed is in the area of agriculture. The Krishi Udan Scheme is focused on transporting perishable food products of farmers from the hilly areas, north-eastern states and tribal areas.India’s civil aviation ministry has also been instrumental in rescuing Indians and foreign nationals during emergencies. As a part of the Vande Bharat Mission, India operated air bubbles to facilitate the travel of 1.83 crore passengers during the various COVID-19 waves. Further, Operation Ganga rescued 22,500 Indian students from Ukraine at the peak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The synergy between tourism and civil aviation in propagating India’s tourism potential is well-known. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Kushinagar airport in October 2021, he said that the airport is a tribute to the devotion of Buddhist communities around the world. He further stated that tourism in all its forms, whether for faith or leisure, needs modern infrastructure and airways are one of the most crucial components. Taking this into account, the Ministry of Tourism also funds more than 50 routes and has approved another 10 routes under the RCS-UDAN Scheme. As we enter Amrit Kaal, Indian aviation is flying high.",      
    "Topic33": "A report in this newspaper, this week, (‘Army’s rightsizing plan: Veterans at training institutes and cross-skilling,’ IE, January 8) took me back to December 2000 when I accompanied Air Chief Marshal A Y Tipnis to Israel as his staff officer. The trip exposed us to several new technologies and working methods. We visited Israel’s Air Force Academy where the country’s rookie pilots were being trained. After the customary briefing, Air Chief Marshal Tipnis enquired how operational aspects were dovetailed with basic training at the academy. The briefing officer pointed towards a few grey-haired people clad in flying overalls and told us that they were air force veterans who had been made a part of the academy’s instructor pool. This was an important learning but his next remark had an even greater impact on us. “Imagine sir, a youngster, aged 19 or 20, being in the same cockpit with an ace. Being taught by veterans, whose combat stories they may have read as part of their training, has a remarkable effect on the morale of the trainees,” he said. That the Indian Army —- one assumes the Air Force and the Navy as well — is planning to take similar steps in some of its training institutions is laudable. Movies of the past stereotyped the veteran as a person who wears a golf cap, smokes a cigar, walks with a swagger and speaks with an anglicised accent. On OTT platforms today, the veteran is sans the cap and cigar but continues to walk with a swagger and has an accent. A veteran, barring exceptions, is a pretty down-to-earth person, wiser with experience and age — someone who can give a lot back to society. Civilian organisations have realised this but surprisingly, till recently, the armed forces did not think of putting the experience of veterans to good use. It’s heartening that policymakers are thinking of applying correctives. Two aspects at the macro level stand out. The first is utilising the expertise of veterans that is otherwise lost — or becomes someone else’s gain. The expertise of IAF and Navy officers has been used by outfits in Australia and the US. The second aspect relates to the shortage of manpower in the services. Veterans can be asked to do “hinterland” jobs and relieve active-duty personnel from operational tasks. The Defence Services Staff College, the three war colleges of each service, administrative schools, specialised engineering institutions and certain areas in maintenance and repair depots are some of the places where the expertise of veterans can be put to good use. First, an overall macro policy needs to be drafted regarding the areas/institutions where veterans can be deployed. That almost every military unit would be holding classified information should not be a bar to utilising veterans — remember, until a recent time, they had access to such information. They do not become persona non grata merely because they have hung up their boots. Second, do not be miserly in paying veterans reasonably. Many, who are out of service due to the steep pyramidical hierarchy in the services, are likely to be in need of finances as they settle their children and pay house mortgages. While drawing contracts, policymakers and the services need to be sensitive to the fact that no veteran would like to keep renewing the terms of engagement every year. Finally, will this endeavour succeed? Of course, it will. One can already see a positive change in mindsets with the National Defence College having a few veterans as full-time subject experts and the IAF’s College of Air Warfare using a distinguished veteran scholar’s expertise in running an advanced airpower course. What stops us, then, from going the whole hog? The military and civilian bureaucracy seems to be reluctant to give up traditional methods. However, it’s heartening that many in the military leadership today are willing to think more creatively. It’s up to them to take decisive steps and also take the government along.",      
    "Topic34": "Much of the discussion on the Union budget has focused on the Centre’s fiscal stance and its spending priorities. But the documents accompanying the budget also provide useful nuggets of information about the corporate, household and government sector, and as a consequence, the changing structure of the Indian economy. Four broad points emerge. First, the larger firms have perhaps never had it so good in recent years. Alongside the trend of the rising share of capital and the falling share of labour in national income, within the larger corporate universe, a few big firms now account for an outsized portion of the pie. In 2019-20, of the 9 lakh plus companies who had filed returns, 433 firms had reported profits (before taxes) in excess of Rs 500 crore. In 2020-21, the first year of the pandemic, this rose to 517. These 517 companies accounted for 62.08 per cent of total profits of the corporate sector in 2020-21. Add to this the 1,558 companies whose profits ranged between Rs 100-500 crore, and together these 2,075 firms (who represent just 0.2 per cent of the entire corporate sector) accounted for 77.41 per cent of all profits. In comparison, just a year prior to the pandemic, firms with profits exceeding Rs 100 crore accounted for 75.2 per cent of total corporate sector profits. Data on listed companies suggests that this concentration of profits is likely to have continued in the period thereafter. While MSMEs and the larger informal sector have been showing some signs of recovery, it is difficult to know whether this stunning concentration of economic power has reversed. Second, for these 517 companies, the effective tax rate works out to around 19.14 per cent, which is much lower than that for the smaller-sized companies. For firms with profits in the range of 0-1 crore and 1-10 crore, the tax rate was 24.82 per cent and 23.13 per cent respectively. As per the documents, these tax rate differentials imply that the larger firms have either availed of the higher deductions or incentives under the old tax regime or have shifted to the new regime of lower taxes. (In September 2019, the government had allowed firms to pay tax at the rate of 22 per cent, provided they did not avail of exemptions/incentives. And further, to attract fresh investments, new firms making fresh investments in manufacturing were taxed at an even lower rate of 15 per cent.). So far, 1.96 lakh or 20 per cent of all firms have opted for the exemption-less regime. As these firms account for a little more than 60 per cent of total income, this suggests that the larger, more profitable firms are opting to shift. This is an encouraging sign. There are also indications that this regime has perhaps led to a reduction in tax disputes. The amounts under dispute which had gone up in 2020-21 from the previous year, fell in 2021-22.However, despite high expectations, only 3,508 companies had opted for the 15 per cent tax regime during this period. This suggests that lower tax rates were perhaps not a strong enough incentive for fresh private sector investments in the manufacturing sector. Third, contrary to expectations, the new personal income tax regime has, so far, not seen much traction. But, it is possible that the changes now being proposed will improve its attractiveness. Migration to the new regime will depend on the extent to which individuals take advantage of the existing exemptions. Broadly speaking, there are four major exemptions that individuals avail of under chapter VI-A, section 80 of the Income Tax Act — these are for investments, health insurance, the new pension scheme, and payment of rent. The revenue foregone by the government on these items ranges from Rs 74,937 crore on investments to Rs 4,810 crore on pension, Rs 6,444 crore on health insurance and Rs 1,361 crore on rent. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that if a salaried taxpayer is availing of exemptions for investments and medical insurance, then the switching point will perhaps be a little less than Rs 9 lakh. However, the more the exemptions are availed, higher will be the income threshold at which the individual will want to switch to the new tax framework. But, considering that very few taxpayers actually use all these exemptions — the revenue foregone by the government provides some sense of how widely used each of these exemptions are — there is a strong possibility that more taxpayers will gravitate towards the new tax regime. Though, to what extent, will also be tempered by individual expectations of wanting to avail these exemptions in the future. This will have implications for the consumption spurt that government officials anticipate from this switch. Fourth, the larger public sector, comprising of central and state governments and central public sector enterprises, now accounts for a much bigger share of overall investment activity in the economy than before. At the end of 2022-23, capital expenditure routed through the Union budget, coupled with the resources of state governments and central PSUs directed towards capital spending, would be just shy of a quarter of all investments (gross fixed capital formation) in the economy. Their share is up by roughly 5 percentage points since 2014-15. In the coming year, if state governments were to just match the central government’s budgeted increase in capex — state governments have in the past tended to allocate more for capital expenditure than the Centre — then it is likely that the share of the public sector in total investments in the economy would inch closer to 30 per cent. Yet, despite record profits accruing to the larger firms, despite lower tax rates for both the corporate and the household sectors, and despite the ramp-up in capital spending by the public sector, a broad-based recovery in private sector investments and consumption has not materialised. Will 2023-24 be any different? Seems unlikely, perhaps the government should ask why.",      
    "Topic35": "Infrastructure is universally acknowledged as a key driver of growth. Traditionally, though, infrastructure is associated with physical assets, typically roads, ports, power transmission lines, etc. However, since 2014, India’s development story has been closely linked with a strong focus on not just physical, but also social and digital infrastructure. Budget 2023 gives a powerful thrust to these three dimensions of infrastructure development which, put together, accelerate inclusive growth. The Government of India’s capital expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased from 1.7 per cent in 2014 to nearly 2.9 per cent in 2022-23. In Budget 2023-24, Rs 10 lakh crore (3.3 per cent of the GDP), an increase of three times from 2019, was allocated for infrastructure. The Ministry of Railways received its highest-ever allocation of Rs 2.4 lakh crore, approximately nine times the allocation in 2013-14. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways saw a 36 per cent increase in its budget to about Rs 2.7 lakh crore. These targeted investments will not only create vital physical infrastructure and improve connectivity that will accelerate the movement of passengers and freight, but also create jobs, spur private investments, and provide a cushion against global headwinds. The direct capital investment by the Centre has been further supplemented by a one-year extension of the 50-year interest-free loan to state governments to encourage infrastructure investment and incentivise complementary policy actions, with a significantly increased outlay of Rs 1.3 lakh crore. This will lead to decentralised infrastructure development in urban and peri-urban areas across regions. A 66 per cent increase in allocation to the PM Awas Yojana will not only provide housing but also create jobs in rural areas. It is apt that the Finance Minister has observed that every rupee spent on infrastructure and capital expenditure gives 2.95 as a multiplier. In contrast, the money given through revenue expenditure gets less than a rupee for every rupee spent. In the last eight years, one can witness the blurring of the digital divide that existed between urban and rural areas. The world has acknowledged India’s phenomenal success in building population-scale platforms at startup speed. This digital transformation of India is happening in two phases. The first phase started in 2015 and was led by the JAM trinity — Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile linkages, and the Digital India programme. This had a huge benefit for the country through increasing penetration of government schemes and efficient financial inclusion. Low-cost accessibility (Aadhaar), the success of citizen-centric services such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), large-scale adoption and reach (DigiLocker, MyGov), and the vaccine journey (CoWin) are all significant and successful milestones in India’s first phase of public digital infrastructure creation. The second phase of digital transformation is now being led by the development, application, and large-scale expansion of cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, mechatronics, robotics, and more. An important domain that the government is focusing on currently is creating open AI resources. In a country like India, with its unparalleled linguistic and cultural diversity, AI has enormous potential as a tool for breaking down language barriers. The Digital India Bhashini portal is a public digital platform that hosts 260 open-source API-based AI models for speech-to-text conversion, machine translation, and text-to-speech conversion in 11 Indian languages and English. Bhashini has the potential to provide crores of Indians with access to the internet and other digital resources in their native languages. This will break linguistic barriers that limit access to technology and provide the benefits of Natural Language Processing to MSMEs and individual innovators in the hinterlands. Similarly, the Agriculture Accelerator Fund announced in the budget will enable the Indian agricultural ecosystem (startups, businesses, and farmers) to work collaboratively and find knowledge-based and farmer-centric solutions to benefit a sector that employs nearly half the workforce of the Indian economy. Investment in social infrastructure — which includes education and skilling, public health and nutrition, drinking water and sanitation — can lead to a more productive and proficient workforce, reduced mortality, wasting and stunting, increased social mobility and a higher quality of life. These factors contribute to a stronger and more inclusive economy and holistic development. Championing these primacies, the total expenditure of the central government in social infrastructure has increased by 134 per cent from Rs 9.1 lakh crore in 2016 to 21.3 lakh crore in 2023. While attention given to backward districts by the Aspirational Districts Programme spearheaded by NITI Aayog through data-driven governance has resulted in consistent macro improvements in key socioeconomic indicators at the district level, the emphasis on digital land records under the SVAMITVA Scheme of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is a structural reform in rural land management that leads to individual economic empowerment. Targeted initiatives announced in the budget such as the mission to eliminate sickle cell anaemia will raise awareness about the near-fatal disease and screening seven crore people between the ages of 0 and 40 will immensely benefit the affected tribal areas. While a 232 per cent expansion in the Non-Communicable Diseases clinics and 320 per cent expansion in the districts covered under the PM National Dialysis Programme were recorded between 2014 and 2022, the government has continued to identify emerging public health challenges and address them.",      
    "Topic36": "The Covid-19 pandemic seems to have made the road to gender equality rockier than before. Reports have documented that the economic blow of the public health emergency has fallen disproportionately hard on women — men had more job security, and could negotiate higher wages, compared to women during the crisis years. Now the All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) for 2020-21 has revealed that crucial gains made in closing the gender gap in undergraduate programmes suffered a setback during the pandemic. In classrooms where men were already in majority — computer science, business administration, pharmacy, technology and law courses, for instance — the number of women has gone down further. And in fields of study where the gender gap had, by and large, been plugged — medicine and commerce — the reverses are significant. The gender ratio in the B.Com course is down to 2016 levels. Cultural notions about careers appropriate for women have traditionally held back their mobility. However, the spurt in aspirations in recent years exercised a steady influence on the gender composition of classrooms. In 2014, for instance, for every 100 male students enrolled in undergraduate commerce programmes, there were 90 female students. This gap was plugged in 2019. In MBBS and B.Sc programmes, the skew was addressed a year earlier. The Covid-related setback to gender equality in college and university classrooms is in contrast to developments in school education. The ASER report, released two weeks ago, shows that exigencies of the pandemic have not diminished parents’ keenness to get their daughters enrolled in schools. However, in a society where women’s education still does not receive adequate importance and the burden of caring for the family falls disproportionately on them, the effect of the crisis on higher education is telling. In the wake of the pandemic, the government was quick to respond to several welfare and equity-related issues. Relief packages under PMJDY and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan — ASHA workers were brought under this package — were announced within days of the lockdown. The SVANIDHI scheme was launched for street vendors, a large percentage of whom are women. But the skew in classrooms threatens grim implications for women’s empowerment, which, in turn, could have a bearing on the nutrition, health and education of future generations. The Centre, state governments and educational institutions must find ways to enable women to return to institutions of higher education. In the short term, this could mean increasing the outlay for scholarships and creating more dorms and hostels. In the long run, this should mean catalysing processes of social change that enable half of the country’s population to attain its aspirations.",      
    "Topic37": "By almost any objective metric, the material lives of Indians — regardless of religion, caste, gender — are better in 2023 than in 1977. But if the imagination of a nation is about more than per capita income, or even health and education levels, the story becomes complicated. A nation is also made of its symbolism — which in its worst form can descend to mere tokenism and at its best, is a form of representation. Shah Rukh Khan’s invocation of Amar Akbar Anthony at an event to celebrate the massive commercial success of Pathaan earlier this week, was a throwback to a time when mainstream cinema — and society — were less polarised than they are today. In response to a question about the controversy around Pathaan and attempted boycotts of the film, Khan said that the cast of the film, like the characters in Manmohan Desai’s 1977 classic, belonged to different religions but were united by a larger purpose — to provide joy to the audience: “This is Deepika, she is Amar, I’m Shah Rukh Khan, I’m Akbar and John he is Anthony…” Khan was gesturing to the sometimes choreographed but mostly unselfconscious inclusivity that has marked Hindi cinema down the years. Bollywood is, of course, a bubble. The Sachar Committee report (2006) wasn’t really needed to show that the condition of India’s largest religious minority remains relatively poor in social, educational and economic terms — cricket team captains and movie stars notwithstanding. And the Amar Akbar Anthony trope is a cliché. Yet, the fact that mainstream blockbusters would promote a secular ethos — without calls for boycott or a barrage of “hurt sentiments” — is something worth remembering. Khan’s comparison is also a hopeful one. It seems that in 2023, as in 1977, the box office doesn’t always reflect the polarisation outside.",      
    "Topic38": "India at 100, for me, will be progressively occupied by the spirit of women. It is the expanse where we’ve transcended from the on-paper legal and constitutional utopia envisioned for women to a space where every woman’s enterprise and individuality are recognised and she is free from the shackles of hackneyed traditions, distorted social perceptions, and contradictory standards of morality. There are no two opinions on the fact that women have progressed since Independence. We now understand and acknowledge that the nation cannot progress if half of it is held back. From laws enabling women to own property and safeguard their interests, to being economically independent and leaving their mark in the business space, Indian women have seized the reins and developed a vision in tune with global developments. As we march towards the 100th year of our Independence, the increasing recognition being given to a comprehensive system of growth must be marked by two factors — not just how and how many women perform, but also how gender-inclusive and representative institutions are and can become. Only 15 and 14 per cent of MPs in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, respectively, are women; 11 women feature in the council of ministers; just 26 per cent of the selected candidates for Civil Services were women; only 23.3 per cent are in the labour force; only 20.37 per cent are MSME owners; only 10 per cent of start-ups in India have women founders; and women only contribute 18 per cent to the nation’s GDP. The discussion now needs to evolve to understand the “whys” along with the “whats” embedded in percentages or numbers. The debate around women’s participation must progress beyond the currently used metric of assessing the availability of opportunities, solutions, and avenues, which is, in my opinion, a unidirectional approach. A more holistic approach would entail an assessment of the comprehensiveness, feasibility, applicability, and accessibility of resolutions — whether in the form of a law, policy or directive — to propel women towards a promising future. At the same time, every step in this direction must have social justice, equality, and inclusivity at its heart. We need to strive to ensure that every woman from a disadvantaged background has the same access to empowering measures as a woman coming from privilege does. We need more regional voices in strategic policy-making decisions, more rural women taking control of their economic decisions, and more women overcoming impediments and climbing the leadership ladder. We need to keep reiterating the same question: What is being done for the women in the country, and is it adequate? A policy is only good as the number of lives it impacts. Tamil Nadu and its history are laced with the impactful legacies of leaders like Thanthai Periyar, C N Annadurai, and Kalaignar M Karunanidhi, who were not only proponents of equality and social justice for women but also set up practical examples for India and the world to emulate. Not only did Kalaignar discuss issues affecting Indian widows in his screenplays, but he also announced financial assistance schemes for them. He instituted the Women Entrepreneurs Scheme, the Women’s Small Trade Loan with Savings Scheme, reservations for women in government jobs and panchayat elections, marriage and maternity benefits, and other policies that have catapulted Tamil Nadu onto the path of development. His vision is what Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin has been furthering. In the next 25 years, I hope for egalitarianism and justice to be the light of the nation. I fervently hope that we catapult more women forward, not only by empowering them to take charge of their lives, but also to impact the lives of thousands of other women, thereby initiating a cycle that creates space for inclusivity, empowerment, and development.",      
    "Topic39": "The survey by the Indian Tax Authorities of the BBC’s entities in India has triggered a wave of predictable responses within the journalistic community, inside and outside India. While some saw personal parallels from their own past experiences in India, real and imagined, others stretched the boundaries of logic and facts to look for misplaced parallels across continents. The developments came on a day when economies on both sides of the Atlantic — France, the UK and the US — got a tremendous boost from the largest order for aircraft in civil aviation history by Air India to Airbus and Boeing. India’s pivotal role in the emerging global order, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at its helm, drawing on its economic strength, demographic weight and democratic ethos has become a matter of awe and consternation for many within the global journalistic community. The rise of Indian democracy under PM Modi has also seen a convergence of interests between global liberal activists and assorted groups of Muslim activists seeking to build a global narrative around alleged Islamophobia. Finding common cause with this convergence, India’s hostile neighbourhood has sought to exploit fault lines within Indian democracy with exaggerated global media reports, adding fuel to fire and borderless activists playing the role of saboteurs. This phenomenon has been well-researched and extensively written about both within India, in the peer-reviewed ‘Journal of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication’ in December 2021 and outside India by global observers of Indian democracy. The strong reactions in India to the BBC Documentary on Narendra Modi must be seen within this context. The documentary has failed key tests of accuracy and journalistic intent, apart from its undermining the integrity of India’s democratic and judicial Institutions. As a taxpayer-funded public institution, The BBC’s conduct being inimical to the Indian state also raised concerns about whether the UK’s public broadcaster was conducting its own foreign policy at the expense of India’s ties with the United Kingdom. The split personality of the BBC, as an entity of the British State domestically and as a commercial operation globally, poses a deeper question on the kind of privilege that entitles it to insert itself into the domestic politics of other nations with its deep pockets and its global brand equity built on the strength of decades of colonialism. It has become fashionable within global journalistic circles to routinely impose on Indian democracy value judgements that are derived narrowly from Western liberalism. Given the sheer scale and diversity of Indian democracy and the socio-economic extremities within India, there is no dearth of socio-political causes for western liberal activists to both sustain themselves and seek patrons globally. This makes Indian democracy uniquely vulnerable to factors beyond its borders in a manner unlike the western democracies where the domestic barriers to such external influences are relatively high. Scepticism in India towards global indices of democracy that have mischaracterised Indian democracy needs to be understood from this perspective. The low tolerance for flawed and exaggerated global media reporting on India also needs to be understood from this perspective given the frequency with which such reports have been carried by prominent media outlets and false narratives on India have been normalised by well-known global journalists. The stark divergence of perception, of Indian democracy under Narendra Modi, between western heads of state and prominent global media outlets raises the question of whether these media outlets, in their pursuit of an editorial agenda, are unwittingly undermining the emerging global order that seeks to secure their democracies. With India playing a pivotal geo-political role in securing global supply chains, stimulating global economic growth and harmonising security interests, it makes one wonder who stands to benefit from the destabilising effects of global media narratives on Indian democracy. The BBC’s tax woes in India are the outcome of persistent non-compliance with the laws of the land even after several notices. The blurring distinction between public broadcasting and commercial media operations cannot be an excuse for non-compliance with tax laws. Deeper scrutiny of such non-compliance cannot be construed as an assault on freedom of speech. The misplaced journalistic outrage over the scrutiny of the BBC’s taxes is reflective of the herd mentality and group-think with which democracy in India has been judged lately. One wonders if the journalistic community would show the same conviction in putting the BBC in the dock once the truth about its tax evasion in India is revealed. Indian democracy is not a petri-dish for the global media’s experiments with the truth, stretching the boundaries of journalistic privilege at the expense of this country’s territorial integrity and the integrity of its institutions. Journalistic freedoms do not exist in a vacuum and media outlets must take responsibility for their conduct both editorially and commercially. Global media activism that seeks to destabilise Indian democracy cannot claim immunity from scrutiny by the Indian state under the pretext of freedom of speech.",      
    "Topic40": "Inflation is proving to be the Achilles heel of the Indian economy’s recovery from the pandemic and subsequent global disruptions. After softening for three consecutive months, it spiked again in January. The RBI has been playing the part of an inflation targeting central bank over the last few months, raising interest rates in an attempt to rein in inflation. However, the fight to bring down inflation is clearly far from over. The latest inflation data also raises the question if the RBI is doing enough. The inflation targeting framework mandates the RBI to achieve a CPI (consumer price index) inflation target of 4 per cent. During the pandemic period of March 2020 to September 2021, CPI inflation averaged 5.9 per cent. This was higher than the point target of 4 per cent but still within the inflation targeting band of 2-6 per cent. Since then, however, the inflation outlook has been worsening. In 2022, CPI inflation was above the upper threshold of the RBI’s targeting band for 10 consecutive months, which meant the target was not achieved for three quarters in a row. Inflation began softening towards the later part of the year. By December 2022, CPI inflation was down to 5.7 per cent. This led many to believe that the inflation peak had passed, and that inflation was on its way to the official target. This optimism was misplaced. Underlying inflationary pressures still persist. The softening of inflation in November and December 2022 was largely driven by a steep fall in vegetable prices. Excluding vegetables, CPI inflation was in fact more than 7 per cent. The misplaced optimism has now become evident. The January 2023 CPI inflation came out to be 6.5 per cent, once again crossing the upper threshold of the RBI’s inflation targeting band. The risks to inflation have continued unabated over the last few months and have contributed to the latest spike in inflation as well. First, with food accounting for 46 per cent of the overall CPI basket, a rise in food inflation from roughly 4 per cent in December 2022 to almost 6 per cent in January 2023 has played an important role in overall inflation going up. Within food, one component that has proved rather stubborn is cereal inflation. Between May and December 2022, year-on-year cereal inflation nearly doubled from 5 per cent to 14 per cent. In January 2023, this increased to 16 per cent. Within cereals, inflation in wheat has been steadily going up. Between May and December 2022, wheat inflation increased from 9 per cent to 22 per cent. It increased even further to 25 per cent in January 2023. The steep rise in wheat prices reflects shortages. Data from the Food Corporation of India shows that stocks in government warehouses declined from 33 million tonnes in January 2022 to 17 million tonnes in January 2023. The government has recently approved a release of three million tonnes in the open market. However, this is insufficient to restore market supplies. Given that the next harvest will not be ready till April, and government stocks in February are further down to 15 million tonnes, this source of inflationary pressure is likely to persist for a while. Second, core (non-food, non-fuel) inflation in January came out to be 6.2 percent. This is consistent with the unyielding core inflation of 6 per cent for nearly three years now. A persistently high core inflation implies that price pressures have become entrenched in the system. Part of this can be explained by the continued pass-through of high input prices to final goods prices. Interestingly, this is happening even when WPI (wholesale price index) inflation, which reflects input prices, has come down from a high of 16 per cent in May 2022 to less than 5 per cent in January 2023. This implies that with margins getting squeezed and profitability suffering, firms are spreading out the pass-through over a longer time period. This makes the core inflation trajectory uncertain. Finally, external factors also play a role. Inflation in developed countries continues to be high (6.4 per cent in the US; 8.5 per cent in the EU; 10.5 per cent in the UK). India is importing some of this elevated inflation through international trade in goods and services. Moreover, with China gradually opening up its economy after nearly three years of zero-Covid restrictions, commodity prices are likely to go up, which could exert renewed pressures on India’s inflation. What have the policymakers been doing to address the inflationary concerns? The government has done its bit by announcing a conservative Union budget for 2023-24. It has accorded primacy to much needed fiscal consolidation, and has refrained from announcing populist measures that could have arguably fuelled demand, and hence inflation. The RBI has been doing its job as well. It increased the policy repo rate from a pandemic low of 4 per cent to 6.5 per cent in a span of 10 months. It has also adopted a hawkish tone, as evident from its latest monetary policy statement. Unlike last year, when despite rising inflation, the monetary policy statements did not contain any forward guidance, the RBI, in its February 2023 statement, emphasised the importance to “remain alert on inflation”, thereby hinting that the monetary tightening cycle is not over yet. Is there anything else that the central bank can do? Having missed the inflation target for three consecutive quarters in 2022, the RBI had to submit a report to the government describing a plan of action that would help bring inflation down. The law does not require either the RBI or the government to disclose the contents of this report. However, given that inflation is proving to be difficult to rein in, and that the 4 per cent target is not likely to be achieved next year either, releasing the report to especially highlight the remedial actions that the RBI plans to undertake might help stabilise inflation expectations, and facilitate the central bank’s own endeavour to fight inflation. A credible glide path to bring inflation down to the target level is of critical importance, particularly now with the national elections around the corner.",

    "Topic42": "A shooting at Michigan State University on Monday left three people dead and five students in critical condition. Students across the US are reeling, but mass shootings are no longer shocking. I grew up in Gurgaon before moving to Los Angeles to attend college at UCLA. While I had heard of bomb threats in nearby Delhi, they never posed an immediate danger. The last major bombing incident in Delhi happened in 2011, nearly 12 years ago. However, school and university shootings are all too common in the US. In 2022, there were more than 600 mass shootings, alongside even more firearm-related homicides and suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive. It was a record year for school shootings, with around 46 incidents in K-12 schools. This year alone, there have been more than 60 mass shootings. As a student living in Los Angeles, the once-distant threat of gun violence is now a reality. It’s only been three weeks since California experienced back-to-back mass shootings. One of those incidents occurred in Monterey Park, only about an hour’s drive from campus. Some of my classmates and friends had loved ones in the community. One of the classes I’m taking this term is about firearm prevention policy. I enrolled in the class out of curiosity, to see if there was some solution we were all missing. What emerged is a complex and current sociopolitical problem that requires urgent action. When I entered my lecture hall yesterday, my professor was at a loss for words. He had come to class prepared to talk about the five-year anniversary of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, which occurred on February 14, 2018, only to realise that another one had taken place. My classmates described the feeling of numbness after hearing about mass shootings nearly every day and a sense of cynicism as gun regulations fail to get passed, year after year. In my first lecture, my classmates discussed how they enter classrooms and assess their safety in the event of an active shooter on campus. Like many students from India, I had never really considered that having glass doors to a classroom would be a safety hazard. Now, I make sure to look at emergency exits, not just in classrooms but in grocery stores, theatres, and other public spaces. Although UCLA’s campus and the surrounding neighbourhoods are relatively safe, the Michigan State shooting proves yet again that colleges in the US aren’t immune to gun violence. Last year, a former lecturer, Matthew Harris, sent threats to the faculty, including a video threatening a mass shooting at UCLA. University officials did not communicate this to us, even though news of the threat had begun circulating in student groups. But Harris was in Colorado while this was happening, so it was unlikely that he could follow through on his threat. Nevertheless, despite student concerns, some professors refused to cancel class, informing students that they would lock and barricade the door if an active shooter incident arose. As I sat in my apartment waiting for updates, I thought about the campus infrastructure. Being a public university, there are no gates or security, which means anyone could walk in — student or not. UCLA finally cancelled all in-person classes and meetings, and Harris was taken into custody the next day. I did not inform my family about the threat until the police department confirmed Harris was in custody. It was difficult to get on the phone with my parents, living halfway across the world, and tell them that my college could be the site of the next mass shooting. It paints a much uglier picture than they expected when I was applying, excited for me to experience student life in America. This incident forced me to consider the possibility that the day could have ended very differently. It had, once before. In 2016, a former doctoral student Mainak Sarkar entered the campus and shot a professor before killing himself. Students criticised UCLA for its response, as many lecture halls and classroom doors couldn’t be locked, and people on campus had to create elaborate set-ups to barricade the door. While my American classmates calmly discuss their active shooter training in school, I feel anxious and unprepared. UCLA didn’t offer any such training or lockdown drills to international students, only a presentation during orientation. Its website contains some resources and guidelines but doesn’t really prepare you for the reality that you could be shot. The situation at UCLA is not unique. For students planning to study in the US, college here offers wonderful opportunities. But the country is reckoning with very real problems like gun violence, which you may confront during your time here.",      
    "Topic43": "Energy transitions are central to the G20 agenda. In 2023, during India’s presidency, the geopolitics and governance of energy have become immensely challenging, as the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, concerns about energy security and, in many cases, the pressure on keeping financial commitments made related to tackling climate change have become complicated. The International Energy Agency counts 20 million more people worldwide without electricity now compared to 2021. Predictably, the worst-affected are in sub-Saharan Africa, which is back to its lowest rate of electrification since 2013. In Europe, the number of people experiencing inadequate energy supply has risen to 80 million from 34 million in 2021. Even middle-income countries in Africa, South America and Asia face fuel and electricity shortages and high levels of inflation. Reduced availability of energy is hurting economies as industries close, and is impacting public health as safe fuels such as cooking gas become expensive. A number of countries also face a balance of payments crisis, partly driven by high energy costs. “Energy poverty” is global and widespread, impacting technology implementation, industry and sustainable development goals — all of which are also G20 goals. An independent task force initiated by Gateway House in October 2022 seeks urgently to find ways to provide energy access, security and affordability. This requires resolving the conflicts between short-and long-term energy targets, addressing energy disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and using creative financing to accelerate the development and adaptation of renewable technologies and new business models utilising these technologies. The G20 has a key role to play in advancing solutions. Three particularly significant recommendations, which can provide immediate runs on the board for India’s G20 presidency are: The G20 should focus on providing financial support for those most in need as a cornerstone of climate action and energy transition in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Protocol and as reinforced and enshrined in the Paris Agreement and successive COPs. This is a natural role for the G20 to play given the involvement of leading economies in it and its convening power. While financial support to developing countries has been increasing, it is nowhere near what will be required for a successful transition. The G20 can galvanise the pursuit of this agenda. Public financing alone will not be enough for dealing with current energy challenges. Private finance is needed along with public finance. That means continued work is needed to align global financial flows with the Paris Agreement goals. Innovative approaches are needed to climate financing, such as blending finance with public and private capital so they work together, and key impediments like exchange rate risk for financing projects must be addressed. The G20 has a critical role to play in strengthening this global agenda, including by a continued step change on climate financing by multilateral banks. A possible game-changer could be the creation of a Global Climate Finance Agency to better integrate and drive this global agenda, including at very practical levels. The agency could be mandated to lower hedging costs to mitigate a key risk faced by developers of green projects and to insure major clean energy projects from potential losses due to problems such as the failure of government utilities to meet supply and payment obligations — a persistent issue in developing countries, including India. Finally, the G20 can harness the significant power of the public procurement system to accelerate energy transitions. There is abundant evidence that, done well, this can be a major driver of change, for instance, by ensuring funding and adaptation at scale. At the same time, the use of public procurement to drive such changes can help prevent the winner-takes-all effect that new technologies often create. Public procurement has a key role to play in accelerating the rollout of critical new technologies such as green hydrogen, electric vehicle transport systems connected to renewable power systems and small modular nuclear reactors, where the G20 can provide global impetus and inspiration. Ultimately, these proposals will mean new business models and new technologies for energy transitions — new tracks for new trains. Financial centres of the G20 countries and their significant business communities, like Mumbai, have a critical role to play in creating this new economy. The G20 should encourage cooperation and collaboration between these centres, including through green financing and economy taxonomies as per the above recommendations, to accelerate climate transition and energy security for all.",      
    "Topic44": "When one comes to a festival like the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFOK) in Thrissur, the experience of watching plays from Lebanon, Palestine, Denmark, along with Peter Brook’s The Tempest as well as plays from around the country, fills one with wonderment at the range and the varied forms and narratives that are being explored.The queues for each show are endless and cut across any stratification. A festival is a special space to be in — it’s a place to connect, to rejuvenate and affirm your relationship with the arts. It’s also a recognition and a belief that every single individual can make a difference. The arts can humanise, help one survive no matter how adverse the situation. The blips and beeps of our existence are transformed into stories, as a witness to the times, as well as a documentation of its history. We are living in very particular times that demand a very specific response. No matter how many obstacles we may encounter, the only thing we have to avoid is despair, inertia or a failure of will. Art is not a better but an alternative existence, not an escape from reality, but an attempt to animate it. India has always had a very strong theatre and storytelling tradition and, in the last 75 years, it has not only lasted — alongside the rising popularity of other media — but also become a reflection of a changing India. In the initial days after Independence, there was a need to assert what it means to be Indian. Yet India is not a monolith — its plurality comes from complex singularities. Girish Karnad and Mohan Rakesh are two ends of the spectrum, both contributing to the formation of a sensibility that started defining Indian theatre. Karnad’s famous play Hayavadana merged tradition and modernity to tell a very contemporary and complex tale about gender, duality and identity. We had Badal Sircar, whose plays had an absurdist tinge, with influences from Eugene Ionesco and Samuel Beckett. Vijay Tendulkar’s Sakharam Binder talked about sexual violence, and Ghashiram Kotwal talked about corruption and lechery, bringing out topics that were previously unarticulated. A brilliant play like Andha Yug by Dharamvir Bharati, which was designed to be a radio play, turned into one of the most theatrically exciting and challenging plays on the Indian stage. In the 1950s and 1960s, theatremakers and playwrights had access, through translation, to plays from different regions, but also to world literature. Each playwright, searching for a grammar and narrative to write, dipped into what they could access, according to their proclivities, politics, and emotional content. Through plays like Adhe Adhure by Mohan Rakesh and Nagamandala by Karnad, women were finally given a voice which defined their desire and confronted the male world in ways that were unprecedented. It was also the time of the great epic, the grand narrative. Then, suddenly, something changed. Women started entering the theatre as directors and wanted to tell their own stories, not through the male gaze. Domestic spaces started being celebrated, washing, cooking and feeding became the leitmotif to tell stories that were personalised, with an assertion that the everyday can contain high tragedy and grand narratives. Shanta Gandhi’s Jasma Odan, a woman’s defiance of a feudal king and her triumph against all odds in the folk narrative tradition, became an instant sensation. Vijaya Mehta and Sheila Bhatia became iconic figures in the world of theatre. Waiting in the wings were Anamika Haksar, Anuradha Kapur, Maya Krishna Rao, Kirti Jain and many more who broke the glass ceiling and set a template of working in a way that was collaborative and defied linearity. Even the most secular theatre had, at its core, a sort of public worship, the unspoken invisible dimension that gives theatre its special space. Traditions like Ram Lila and Koodiyattam bring us great stories from our intangible heritage. These divine rituals were a way to resolve anxieties and for communities to stay connected. The artist tried to stay alert to the space between uncertainties and conviction, between hope and hopelessness, between Eros and Thanatos. Theatre is also about the audiences. And the magic of an actor performing live before an audience can only be experienced. There is that little invisible thread that is thrown by the actors from the stage into the audience, which binds people coming from different worlds into some kind of collective experience. They may experience it differently, interpret it differently. Some may have come for the story, some for the aesthetics and some for the music — but they are all experiencing something together because theatre is about community. Today actors are more focused, wishing to chisel their art through training of the body and mind, as they recognise that art is hard. It is also about uncertainty and failure and it’s about never losing heart. I recently did a huge production of Hayavadana for Aadyam, with actors from NSD, local actors, musicians and singers, most coming from varied worlds. I was really happy at their capacity to surrender. The spirit of learning and curiosity is in evidence as actors struggle to arrive at the core of their character. It’s a hard journey for everyone involved in this process, which can only happen through surrender and belief.I am hopeful about the future. Our humanity is being tested every day. We falter and fall, seeking hope and affirmation, while everything is in a slow dissolve before us. Each one of us is struggling to reaffirm our existence, our sense of being “alive” amidst a crumbling system. But art does not have an agenda or always a politics to argue — it explores a different kind of anarchy, raw vulnerabilities and systems.",      
    "Topic45": "Suva, the capital of Fiji, is hosting the 12th World Hindi Conference between February 15 and 17. According to the Ministry of External Affairs’ officials, India has achieved limited progress at the United Nations regarding Hindi. The UN has now made a provision to provide all the important messages and press releases in Hindi, just as in languages such as Urdu and Bangla. However, the government is making all efforts to ensure a rightful place for Hindi at the UN. Hindi is India’s outreach to the world, especially in places that received Indian indentured labourers during the 19th century. Though Hindi is not officially the national language of India, it is the strongest link language besides being one of the two official languages. According to the 2011 census, 528 million Indians speak Hindi as against Bengali (97.2 million), Marathi (83 million) Telugu (81 million) and Tamil (69 million) speakers. In this backdrop, it would be pertinent to appreciate the importance of India’s efforts to make Hindi an UN-recognised language. For any Indian language to go global, the first and foremost need is to recognise and respect all of them. When it comes to politics, many recklessly indulge in linguistic chauvinism. But as observed often, the next-generation family members of such politicians are schooled in English medium. Unlike in France, Germany or Spain, speaking in Hindi or regional languages is considered inferior in India, thanks to the burden of colonialism. Sadly, the ability to converse in English has become a status symbol. For Indian languages to go global, they need to be first respected in their motherland. Languages are vehicles of culture. Language is also a living organism and every language keeps evolving. No language can continue to grow without accommodating some more meaningful terms from sister languages. However, this should not be seen as licence to accept all kinds of mindless adulterations. Languages that are considered prestigious and powerful have a tendency to encroach on other languages. Without being extremely puritanical, Hindi needs to be saved from the onslaught of English and other Indian languages from English and Hindi. Hindi-speaking people should ensure that the respect and recognition often denied to them by the English-speaking elite, is generously offered to all other Indian languages. Usage is the lifeblood of any language. If we stop using Hindi or any other Indian language for English, their very existence will be under threat. Here comes the importance of hand-holding between Indian languages. Acclaimed literary works in Indian languages are likely to be translated into English, but not Hindi. For all Indian languages to grow together, quality translations from Indian languages to other Indian and world languages are a must. It is high time we evolve a mechanism for translating award-winning literary works in Indian languages into all UN languages. The emphasis in New Education Policy on education in the mother tongue is significant in this respect. Engineering and medical education in Hindi is now a reality, thanks to this policy push. If other Indian languages follow suit, they could effectively evolve as languages of the knowledge era. New concepts, new technologies and new knowledge-creation demand new coinages and new terms. In the pre-independence era, English befriended Hindi. But in a globalised world, Hindi also needs to engage with other foreign languages, especially in the neighbourhood. From Sinhala to Uzbek and Bhutani to Khmer, Hindi and other Indian languages have to build more linguistic bridges. Hindi (and also all those who speak Hindi) has to endear itself, create space for itself and grow naturally. An individual relates to a language if s/he is able to know or appreciate the ethos around the respective language and its ornamental proverbs and sayings. To understand the meaning of “Lady protests too much”, one has to be familiar with Shakespeare and Hamlet. This is true for all languages. Hence, understanding our very own cultural moorings, taking legitimate pride in our history and our heritage is the prerequisite of our efforts for the sustenance of languages. In that sense, Hindi and other Indian languages have to further strengthen their roots and then expand their horizons. And this needs to be undertaken simultaneously and not one after the other. The path of saving the world from cultural-flattening goes via strengthening our linguistic traditions that are “ever ageing but never old”.",      
    "Topic46": "Amidst the heartbreak of loss and death, sudden miracles keep hope alive in the search and rescue teams currently engaged in earthquake-hit Turkey. One such miracle was the discovery of a six-year-old girl, alive, in Noordagi, Turkey, 80 hours after a series of earthquakes, beginning with a massive one on February 6 which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale, devastated the region last week. For the India’s National Disaster Response Force team that was deployed in the city as part of Operation Dost, the girl’s successful rescue was the “crowning moment” of their efforts, made possible by Julie, a six-year-old labrador. Julie is one of the four dogs accompanying the 151 NDRF personnel of Operation Dost in Turkey. It was her bark that alerted the team to the presence of six-year-old Beren under the rubble. Dogs like her are specially trained to sniff out live human presence under massive piles of rubble as well as find the dead. NDRF’s dogs have been instrumental in several rescues around the country, when buildings or other structures have collapsed and in fires, and were also used in Nepal after it was hit by a massive earthquake in 2015. In Turkey, dog teams from around the world have been flown in to help, including from Mexico, whose specialised canine response team, used for operations in the central American earthquake-prone zone, shot to international fame thanks to its work after the 2017 Puebla earthquake. Dogs are key to the success of rescue operations such as the one going on in Turkey, especially as the hours pass and hopes of finding people alive in the rubble grow dimmer. As a tweet by NDRF put it, having a dog “will bless you with many of the happiest days of your life” — and it will also be a blessing on “one of the worst”.",      
    "Topic47": "On Tuesday, a World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) report occupied centre stage at the UN Security Council’s first-ever debate on the impact of sea-level rise on global peace. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited the document to warn of “a mass exodus of population on a biblical scale”. The report — whose release coincided with the landmark UNSC session — adds to the growing corpus of studies that underline the climate vulnerabilities of people living in low-lying areas. But it projects a crisis that’s frightful, even by the dire standards of climate reports. More than one in 10 people in the world, including those in megacities like Mumbai, New York, London, Dhaka, Shanghai and Buenos Aires, could face severe turmoil even if global warming is miraculously limited to 1.5 degrees — the Paris climate pact’s goal. The task for policymakers then is to prepare for massive social and economic dislocation. This will require building resilience at several levels. For instance, investing in R&D, infrastructure and warning systems to mitigate the loss of lives and property. Protecting coasts could require engineering, technological and ecological interventions — creating physical barriers, permeable pavements, sopping waters or reviving mangroves. The jury is out on several innovations. Engineering solutions are often criticised because even the most robust protective structures deflect the energy of the waves to other areas. Armoured shorelines can also upset the delicate ecological balance of coastal habitats. In recent times, innovations to overcome such deficiencies by combining engineering and ecological approaches have been tried. But a lot of the state-of-the-art green know-how remains out of reach for a majority of the worst affected countries. Technology and fund transfer commitments at UN summits have rarely been in proportion to the gravity of the challenge at hand — in any case, follow-up on even the most sincere commitment has been far from being adequate. As the WMO has warned, the rising seas are a “threat-multiplier”. The rushing salty waters can aggravate disparities by playing havoc with agrarian systems and ruining the livelihoods of fishing communities. International law may well have to engage with the requirements of people dislocated by the sea, many of them rendered stateless. At the same time, dealing with emergencies, mitigating hardship and preparing people to deal with the vagaries of climate will require political will and action at the level of local governments. In India, this could test the resolve of urban municipalities and civic bodies that have struggled to do justice to their mandate, even in normal times.",      
    "Topic48": "Around a year after it returned to the TATA fold, Air India, on Tuesday, announced that it had placed an order for 470 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing. The deal, which is the biggest in aviation history surpassing the American Airlines deal in 2011, is meant to modernise the airline’s fleet and expand its network. As per the timelines laid out by the company, the first new aircraft will enter service in late 2023, with the bulk expected to arrive from mid-2025 onwards. A re-energised airline will expand the choices before the consumer, increasing competition in the domestic market where it will take on market leader, Indigo, and in the international travel market, challenge the dominance of Middle Eastern carriers. After witnessing traffic collapse during the pandemic, India’s aviation market has seen a sharp pick up. As per data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the country’s domestic air traffic rose to 127.35 lakh passengers in December 2022, up 13.7 per cent from 112.02 passengers over the same period last year. With more than half the market share, IndiGo leads the pack, followed by Air India and Vistara. Currently, Air India is reported to have 115 aircraft. While including other TATA group airlines such as Vistara, the number of aircraft under the group is higher, its active fleet is lower than that of Indigo. However, considering that this new order is more than the existing capacity of the entire group, it will help boost Air India carry capacity significantly, placing it in an extremely challenging position. Moreover, this aircraft capacity expansion is also in line with the government’s priority of expanding physical infrastructure to greatly enhance connectivity across the length and breadth of the country. The number of airports in the country has risen from 74 to 147 in the past eight years. And the recent Union budget mentioned that “50 additional airports, heliports, water aerodromes and advance landing grounds” will be revived across the country. Such deals also serve to emphasise the growing size and strength of the Indian economy. They underline the attractiveness of India as a market, and an investment destination — the country is, after all, on path to becoming the third largest economy in the world. But this growing economic heft also adds to diplomatic heft. Considering the manner in which the deal has been celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic — US President Joe Biden has called the deal a “historic” one, French President Emmanuel Macron has hailed it as a “new success”, and said there was a “historic opportunity” to come together, while British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the “landmark deal” — this growing economic clout will create greater space for India to negotiate more favourable terms for itself in international negotiations, leverage situations to its advantage, and assert itself on the global area.",

    "Topic50": "For most people, the image of the “Bollywood romance” is a straight couple (the woman likely in a chiffon sari), singing and dancing on an idyllic mountainside – the natural beauty of the locations combined with lyrics meant to evoke love and passion, Bollywood-style. Arguably, the man responsible for the creation of this image is filmmaker Yash Chopra. A new Netflix documentary series, The Romantics, traces Chopra’s filmmaking career, from message-laden, “nationalistic” films like Dhool Ka Phool (1959) and Dharmputra (1961) to action-dramas like Deewar (1975) to the series of love stories, like Daag (1973), Silsila (1981), Lamhe (1991), Chandni (1989) and Veer-Zaara (2004) that established him as a master of the romance genre. A quick look at Chopra’s filmography will show that he loved depicting love. A deeper look will reveal a filmmaker unafraid to tackle mature, “bold” themes, including adultery and age gaps in relationships. In various interview clips featured in the series, Chopra is seen talking about making films that “touch” his heart; in tackling themes that few others would touch in a still-conservative industry, he said that he was merely showing what was “already there”. One of Chopra’s most transgressive films was Silsila (1981), a rare mainstream film addressing extra-marital love. Shockingly for its time, the film’s sympathy lay with its adulterous lead characters, their story framed as one of star-crossed lovers. Silsila also showed the vulnerability of each character: The lovers who were torn apart when younger and then reunited, and their spouses who try their best to navigate this new twist in their lives. In Chopra’s hands, nothing is sordid, even as the film manages to discuss the possibility of love and marriage being mutually exclusive. The film flopped, despite its conservative ending (the married couples stay married and even fall in love with each other). Lamhe (1991) was another film by Chopra that dealt with a love not entirely accepted by society. As a young man, Viren (Anil Kapoor) falls in love with Pallavi (Sridevi) who is a few years older and in love with another man. Decades after her death, he falls in love with Pallavi’s grown-up daughter Pooja (also played by Sridevi). While the first half showed that it is possible to love someone and still let them go, the second half showed the inner turmoil of a man who comes to love a woman much younger than him, complicated by the fact that she looks exactly like the woman he once loved, despite having a very different personality. Incidentally, Chopra had been warned by his son Aditya against making Lamhe, which he described as “dangerous”. He told his father that the country was not ready for the film, thus revealing himself to be the more conservative filmmaker of the two. It’s not surprising then that Aditya’s directorial debut, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge (1995) was YRF’s next big love story. In a way, it signified the reins being handed over from one generation to the next (Chopra did not stop being involved in films after his son’s debut). At the same time, DDLJ, even as it retained the glamorous trappings that YRF romances were known for — the stunning natural beauty of Switzerland and grand sets and costumes — had very little of the earlier films’ subversiveness. Over the course of the film, the hero Raj transforms from a “bad” British-Indian who steals beer from a fellow NRI to a man with such deep reverence for Indian “morals” and traditions that he refuses to elope with his beloved Simran — no matter how much she and her mother beg him to — insisting that he will win her father’s approval for their relationship. What changed? Much can and has been said about the turn that DDLJ marked, not only in YRF’s films, but in the Hindi film industry in general, and how it was influenced by and influenced post-liberalisation changes in India. The new romance reflected the new Indian – a consumer who bought more and became more global while holding on to a conservative, almost reactionary notion of “sanskaar”. However, one thing is certain: Yash Raj Films would never be the same again.",      
    "Topic51": "For almost a year now, Delhi, the capital of the world’s largest democracy, has been running without an elected mayor. The Supreme Court postponed the election of a mayor and deputy mayor again earlier this week – the election has already been delayed three times. This ongoing situation with no end in sight highlights the pressing need for democratically-elected and accountable local city administrations. India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world: We are aspiring to be a 40 trillion economy by 2047. Sixty per cent of our GDP is generated in urban centres. Our cities are engines of economic growth and innovation, where productive firms, better-paying jobs and key institutions are located. Every second Indian now lives in an urban centre with the number of people living in urban areas expected to double by 2050. Rapid urbanisation has led to increased job opportunities, increased wages, and a higher quality of life for many people. Additionally, the increased density and connectivity of cities have made it easier for people to access essential services, such as healthcare and education. However, fast urbanisation has also come with its challenges. For example, cities are now home to a range of social and economic problems, such as poverty, overcrowding, and air pollution. Additionally, the influx of people into cities has led to a shortage of housing, and many people have been forced to live in substandard conditions. To address the challenges posed by rapid urbanisation in India, the governance of our cities must improve to match global standards. The 74th constitutional amendment, introduced in 1992, mandated the empowering of urban local bodies towards better functioning. However, in the last three decades, not much has improved in Indian cities. While lack of untied funding is a major challenge for city administrations, a bigger challenge for our cities under the current regime is the centralisation of administration at the hands of a select few bureaucrats appointed by the Union or state government. This tendency towards increasing bureaucratic control and centralisation goes against the principles laid down in the 74th amendment and is proving to be detrimental to the interest of millions of Indians who live and earn their livelihood in our cities. Several municipalities, small and big, are being run in the country by Central or state government-appointed bureaucrats, and elections are either being delayed or scrapped without any accountability to the citizens. For close to a year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – the country’s richest civic body – has been managed by an administrator after its term expired and polls were delayed. Further, an astonishing 22 of 28 municipal corporations in Maharashtra have seen their terms expire with fresh polls nowhere in sight. In Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, state governments have been delaying the local body elections under some pretext or the other. This high-handed manner of dealing with urban local bodies in BJP-ruled states leads to dysfunctional and unaccountable city governance. It also breaks citizens’ trust in the system as they lose hope without having democratically elected councillors to represent their interests and address grievances. In Delhi, after completing a 15-year tenure in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in March 2022, the BJP, through the Centre, delayed the MCD election by eight months on the pretext of merging the three corporations and an unscheduled delimitation exercise. Elections were finally held in December 2022. However, the process of electing the mayor has been disrupted maliciously in the interest of continuing administration through the central government-appointed bureaucracy. This is happening at a time, when Delhi, the national capital will be hosting the G20 summit. Major global cities like New York, Tokyo and London have strong local governments, where elected mayors are designated as executive heads. Both Mumbai and Delhi, at the moment, are administered by unelected bureaucrats. The Expert Committee on Urban Infrastructure (2011) recommended that the ‘Commissioner’ should act as a city manager and should be recruited through a transparent search-cum-selection process led by the mayor. But in India, political interference from the central government, either through the governor or Lt Governor’s Office, gives a backdoor entry to party workers of the ruling party to the corporation — in the long run, the country suffers. The Prime Minister often speaks about “Amrit Kaal” and the “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”, and this decade belonging to India. But the actions of his government seem to derail what is required to build a strong democratic structure in the country. Notable Indian freedom fighters campaigned hard for better civic governance in cities. Aruna Asaf Ali and Subhash Chandra Bose were elected mayor.Indian urban local bodies are amongst the weakest in the world in terms of fiscal autonomy and have limited effective devolution of revenue. They also have limited capacity to raise resources through their own sources of revenue such as property tax. Municipal revenue in India accounts for only one per cent of the GDP (2017-18). This leads to a dependence on transfers by the state and central government. For the nation to grow, it is important that our growth engines, the cities, remain a space for vibrant democracy and accountable civic governance. It is now time to restore cities of the people, by the people, for the people.",      
    "Topic52": "There were Cinderella stories plenty on a busy, buzzing auction on Monday of the Women’s Premier League (WPL). Except, these fairy tale protagonists wore cricket cleats not crystal sandals, and kept them on, not needing to be rescued by anybody else. The world’s leading women cricketers notched hefty WPL contracts — India star Smriti Mandhana on top of the pile with Rs 3.4 crore — for themselves from the five bidding franchises based on their skill, and sowed dreams of earning big from cricket in young minds who will look up to them. Not quite 25 even, Siliguri’s Richa Ghosh might become a home owner soon if her father’s dream of buying her a house near Eden Gardens plays out after going for Rs 1.9 crore. With the BCCI coming good on its pledge to offer an equal platform to women cricketers, a whole bunch of aspiring athletes can dream of taking up that sport as a career, and play in front of large crowds, just like the men, if they can summon equally thrilling cricket. The early figures are impressive. Only the women’s NBA and England’s Women’s Super League in football reportedly have bigger broadcast deals. England cricket star Nat Scivers’ Rs 3.2 crore earning is almost three times her national central contract and it is a staggering 10 times the highest sum paid out in the Hundred or Australia’s women’s Big Bash. Leading female rugby players in England earn a sixth of that figure, and Scivers will pocket a cool £100,000 more than what England’s UEFA Euro captain and Arsenal star, Leah Williamson was believed to have been paid in the 2021-22 season. More importantly though, all the cricketers will now be able to avail the technical, financial and strategic coaching expertise of a pro league. For the Indian team, the timing couldn’t have been any better. Freshly minted U19 champions, the start of the WPL means franchises will begin to deploy scouting armies into the hinterland to unearth talent. India is yet to win an ICC World Cup for women and the WPL gives a fillip to women’s domestic structure, as franchise expertise will likely extend to women’s teams. The likes of Mahela Jayawardene will be available to pick brains of, while the best of analysts, physios, trainers and specialist coaches will become available. Expect the skills and big-hitting to upgrade several notches in coming years. The big test of course is if the five teams will be able to pull in the crowds to the bleachers like the men’s game does and much curiosity centres around finding that answer.",      
    "Topic53": "Less than a month ago, the Union Ministry of Information & Broadcasting invoked “emergency” powers under the 2021 IT Rules to order online media platforms to take down links sharing the first part of the BBC documentary, India: The Modi Question. On February 14, the Income Tax Department conducted “surveys” at the BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai — the first step in what is widely seen as a process-is-punishment treatment. Officials have alleged that the BBC is “non-compliant” under transfer pricing rules and has “diverted significant” profits. The BBC has said it is “fully co-operating” with authorities and hopes to have this “situation resolved” soon. Of course, the BBC has to answer to the law and has to address whatever questions the tax authorities have. But the parallel commentary by one of the ruling party’s national spokespersons trashing the news organisation as “corrupt” and “rubbish” and accusing it of supporting “anti-national” forces raises more than one question mark on due process. The action against the British media organisation with a global presence has come on the heels of the controversial documentary on the PM which the government has said sows “divisions among various communities, and (makes) unsubstantiated allegations.” Given the recent record of the government vis a vis sections of the media and civil society, the latest action against the BBC — the survey, taken together with the political attack — smacks of bullying and an attempt to intimidate. Regrettably, this is part of a disquieting pattern. Last September, the tax authorities conducted similar surveys against Oxfam India, think tank Centre for Policy Research — which, incidentally, works with many state governments — and the Independent and Public Spirited Media Foundation (IPSMF). The latter funds multiple digital media entities across political persuasions, some of which have been critical of the government. During those surveys, too, some phones and devices were seized, staff questioned, the inquiries hang fire, the cloud of uncertainty is allowed to hover. Surely, Income Tax personnel being sent to a news organisation in the middle of the day is meant to send a message to that organisation and, arguably, it is the message to others, too. It would be simplistic — and inaccurate — to dismiss this as the knee-jerk response of an insecure government. For, this is a government not exactly insecure and it rarely jerks its knee. Herein lies the rub. Asked about such action, the BJP has a stock answer: why worry about a survey or a search if you have nothing to fear? That question is loaded at a time when the IPC is being weaponised at the drop of a police complaint or an FIR, be it the case of a stand-up comic or a professor’s cartoon. The BJP knows that sending tax officers and inspectors to newsrooms and think tanks is borrowing a leaf from a discredited playbook once used by a regime they had so stridently opposed. Surely, they also know that it has its limitations.",      
    "Topic54": "Responding to the Hindenburg Research expose on Gautam Adani’s business empire and its practices, the group’s spokespersons claimed it was a “calculated attack on India”. While no senior Union government functionary has echoed this charge, some supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party have posted statements on social media echoing the “Adani is India” claim. Why does this sound particularly excessive in the case of this conglomerate? A company or a brand gets identified with a country when it is popular either in the mass consumer market or the share market. That requires a loyal social support base built over time. In a hurry to become a billionaire, Adani has not yet secured that social base and has instead depended largely on securing political support. The Adani group companies have neither a domestic retail shareholder base nor are they associated with a popular consumer brand that would identify a company with a country. He is not yet in the league of “Hamara Bajaj” nor are there thousands of Adani shareholders who pack a huge auditorium like Dhirubhai Ambani’s beneficiaries.Given the scale of Adani’s investments and ambition, his name may well come to be identified with India at some future date, if he manages to recover the ground lost by the Hindenburg expose and the various regulatory enquiries underway, but he is not there yet and the journey has become tougher. For his company to be identified with his country, Adani would have to build a social base among investors and consumers that his infrastructure-focused and politically-connected business has not yet helped create.Governments or consumers do act in favour of or against certain companies and brands as part of a larger geopolitical narrative. When George Fernandes, as Union industries minister in 1978, asked Coca-Cola and IBM to quit India, he was not just directing his aim against those companies, but at the US. Indian companies have also either benefitted or paid a price for being viewed as representatives of India, especially in our neighbourhood. The Tatas faced problems in Bangladesh, GMR in the Maldives, the Dabur group in Nepal and Adani in Sri Lanka. Adani may have raced forward to catch up with Mukesh Ambani to become the richest man in Asia, using many of the stratagems that the senior and junior Ambani used, but with a significant difference. Dhirubhai Ambani built his business empire creating a massive shareholder base. No business leader was given the kind of farewell that the citizens of Mumbai gave him when he passed away in 2002, marching in their thousands, behind scores of political and business leaders from across the country, in the funeral procession. Dhirubhai won widespread public support at home, especially among the vocal middle class, both by building an army of shareholders, sharing his prosperity with them, and selling branded products that they loved. “Only Vimal” became his calling card. Both Ambani and “Hamara Bajaj” had intimate links with powers that be in successive governments in New Delhi and across the country. They protected these links by building a wider support base among shareholders and consumers. Gautam Adani tried to get onto the fast track of using political links to secure government contracts, invest in non-branded infrastructure and raise funds from big financiers, mainly based overseas. The social base of the Adani group was limited by both the nature of its business, mainly infrastructure, and the method of its financing, mainly institutional and unidentified overseas investors. Given the nature of the business environment in India most, though not all, business leaders find it necessary and helpful to maintain political links. In my book, India’s Power Elite (Penguin, 2021), I have examined the historical evolution of the nexus between business and politics, noting that the phenomenon of crony capitalism, rooted in a “licence-permit-control Raj” of the past, is today defined by a “regulation and investigation Raj” where business fear is politically encashed. One could argue that capitalism has always been defined by cronyism, entailing an interdependence between business and government, be it in a democracy or in an authoritarian system. Unhappy with the growth of what some have called “state capitalism” in the 1950s, the late JRD Tata funded the Swatantra Party, a political party that espoused the ideals of “free enterprise” and stated that “the business of the State is not business but government”. While Jawaharlal Nehru told Tata that the Swatantra Party would not go very far, G D Birla told a meeting of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Calcutta: “I can tell you from my political experience there is not the slightest chance for any Swatantra Party or any Jana Sangh or any other party to come to power to replace the Congress. You can break the Congress. You can weaken it, but it is not going to help. You will be replacing this government by a Communist government and they will be the first to cut your throat… Therefore, I say that with all its faults I support the Congress.” Substitute “Swatantra and Jana Sangh” in that quote with Congress and Congress with BJP, you could then substitute Birla with Adani. It’s that belief that there is only one centre of political power that often makes business persons place all their eggs in one basket. There are hundreds and thousands of companies, big and small, that have grown on the strength of their entrepreneurship and professionalism. However, there is no denying that dozens of big business groups are where they are today because of political patronage. Certainly, till now, Adani has been a beneficiary of his visible proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now he pays a price for it, for few would believe that he became so wealthy so quickly merely on the strength of his enterprise and business acumen. While politicians need funds to win elections, business persons seek or need, or made to feel they need, political patronage to carry on with their business. This relationship of interdependence has grown with time despite changes in the political dispensation, in New Delhi and the states.",      
    "Topic55": "Fifteen years after the IPL was born the WPL. Like an elder sibling, its holding hands and helping the younger one take baby steps in the world of professional cricket leagues. That is the WPL’s biggest strength too — it has a guiding force watching every stride, showing the path forward, holding the hand when it stumbles, and teaching lessons from its own follies. The WPL has a model to replicate, a blueprint of twinkling success, and it could do to women’s cricket in the country what IPL did to men’s cricket. That is to make India the hub of women’s cricket. There are striking coincidences in the milieus they were born into. When IPL was launched, the country was not the most predominant cricketing force in the world, for all the starry talents it possessed. But they had just won the T20 World Cup and months before the auctions, claimed the U-19 world championship, making millionaires out of a host of impressionable teenagers, some of whom would develop eventually into the greats of the game. Similarly, as competent as India are in women’s cricket, they are yet to be world-beaters. How agonisingly they ended up losing the World T20 in Australia. But just weeks before the WPL auction, India secured the U-19 Women’s World Cup, and some of the protagonists walked away with hefty pay-cheques, like Richa Ghosh and Shafali Verma. Both could form the nucleus of a world-dominating India side, like Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja, stars of the 2008 U-19 World Cup triumph. It’s no accident either that India’s most dominant era in cricket came after the emergence of the IPL. They might have just one Champions Trophy and World Cup title to show in the IPL-era, nonetheless, they have become a genuine force, winning Test series abroad, twice in Australia, besides consistently reaching the last four or beyond (three finals and as many semifinal appearances). Propelling their vaulting growth were talents unearthed from nondescript corners by diligent scouts with sharp eyes on the talent-gifted, talents that would have gone unspotted and wasted. If IPL did not exist, India perhaps would not have discovered its most sparkling fast-bowling diamond ever, Jasprit Bumrah. A conventional journey seemed unseemly for Bumrah, whose unconventional action could have been tweaked, tampered or even torn apart several times over. A bowler of such natural potential could have gone wasted had not Mumbai Indians’ local scouts not informed head scout John Wright about the lanky lad with a wicked straight-arm action and a stuttering, unrhythmic run-up. Or a dozen others, from Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel to Umran Malik and Kuldeep Yadav. Some of them were too irresistible talents to not have emerged at some point, but the IPL accelerated their growth. They were fast-tracked into a world-class stage, sculpted and polished in quick time, more than perhaps how they would have developed in conventional ways, climbing up the ladder in domestic cricket. What might have taken them 10 years could consume just five years or fewer, with world-class grooming and exposure to the finest cricketers in the world. The scouting in women’s cricket might not be as extensive as it is in men’s cricket yet. But it can change in the twitch of an eye, franchises might have already dispatched their scouts far and wide to cast the talent net. More talents to the fore inevitably means more depth. In another two years, the auctions will not just be about internationally-stamped names like Richa and Shafali, but unknown players from unheard locales of the country. More players in the forefront means more competition and more competitiveness. At their disposal would be world-class coaches, facilities and trainers looking to squeeze out the last drops of their talents. Naturally, both the quality and quantity of the domestic tournaments too would shoot up. Young girls would devote more time and energy to the game, aware that it could not only pay their bills but also make their lives secure. Even if you might not play for your country, even if your time with the national teams is short, you could still be relevant, you could still be playing in a franchise, or finding your calling as a support staff or a commentator. It builds a whole new industry, self-existing and self-sustainable. Parents would no longer discourage them to devote their time to the game; coaches would no longer shut the gates in their faces; academies would sprout; women’s cricket would no longer be a hard sell — Rs 951 crore for broadcast rights itself is a massive victory and a portent. When March arrives, the excitement for the real tournament to begin too would shoot up. If it forges a bond with the audience, it could assure that the profile of women’s cricket in the country will vault into the bright summer skies of the subcontinent. Thus, the WPL could both emancipate and enlighten women’s cricket. And when it slips and stumbles there is always the elder sibling to look up to for direction.",      
    "Topic56": "I was a history student at the University of Delhi in the late 2000s. At college, we still submitted hand-written essays though the trend tipped towards typed essays at the North Campus. I wrote assignments on the causes of the First World War and the decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation. To write these essays, we spent days in the library going through hundreds of pages. Of course, there were always friends who repackaged an old assignment from another college or an old class, which, due to the unavailability of software like Turnitin, passed the plagiarism radar. In 2023, the challenges to our education system are greater. Educators across the world have raised suspicion that the new Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool, Chat GPT, would further enable cheating and plagiarism in assessed assignments and school homework. An education system recovering from the COVID-19-induced online mode of learning is again being tested by the IT-led world. ChatGPT, developed by a San Francisco-based company, OpenAI, marks a significant AI advancement. It is an AI tool that allows the exchange of information in a conversational format. So, you ask questions on the platform, and the ChatGPT bot will provide you with an answer. Let’s say you are unhappy with the response. The bot can ask for additional information, and it might come up with an improvised answer. You could also tweak your questions and problems, and the bot will come up with improvised solutions. ChatGPT corrects itself, learns from conversations, and comes up with more precise responses. Various forms of written assignments and presentations that educational institutions rely on to test students’ skills and acquired knowledge are readily available through ChatGPT. Trials done in the UK confirm ChatGPT’s ability to produce more than a passing essay in half an hour. This has the potential to bring conventional forms of assessments under greater scrutiny. There are various solutions to get around the potential ways ChatGPT may be misused, such as a Chat GPT-specific plagiarism-detector software. However, take-home assignments always rely on the honesty of students. In the global education market, various platforms exist that anyway help students in writing their graded assignments who, in return for money, read students’ modules and readings and write the desired answers for them. Unlike copy-paste assignments, which are detectable through Turnitin, these bogus essays are impossible to detect if the classes are large. The way ahead is to change the conventional forms of assessments and introduce varied methods to test students’ creativity and knowledge and instil skills. It is an opportunity for our education system to make students not passive recipients of the curriculum but co-creators of an evolving knowledge economy. While in-person exams are the ultimate proof against any assisted student coursework, exams can only test students in certain areas: Memorisation, written skills, time management, and knowledge attainment. However, a 100 per cent examination-based assessment format raises concerns about an equitable education system. Not all students can be good with handwriting, memorisation and controlled exam hall written exercises. Within social sciences and humanities, one way of moving forward is to make assessed oral presentations, and primary source extract analysis, with compulsory referencing and footnoting, a part of the essential curriculum design. Educational institutions will also have to invest in sophisticated online submission software and plagiarism tools that can detect bot-assisted assignments. These should be implemented early in education, including in senior secondary schools and undergraduate degrees. Primary source extract analysis can be a way to deal with any form of assisted assignment. Thus, a political science course could ask the student to analyse a specific portion of a bilateral treaty and a political speech and explain its relevance in the wider world and scholarship. Early exposure to primary source data could also motivate students to be more engaged as it might give them the sense that they are co-creators of knowledge. To enable this, the inclusion of a selected group of primary sources in the course will be a prerequisite. Oral presentations will enhance and test students’ communication skills, time management, and information-organisation abilities. These would also push students to be more creative and engaged in the learning outcomes of the courses. Here, assisted presentation is a danger, but at least students would learn to translate their written knowledge into oral formats. But with a proper emphasis on healthy practices, such as referencing and bibliography, the evils of assisted assignments could be dealt with. Introducing such a scheme in countries like India with a large student body becomes even more necessary. It is important to train future generations in ways that instil in them hard/honest work, precise knowledge, critical, analytical, and communication skills, and other employable and life skills.",      
    "Topic57": "The history of India’s use of air power in all its wars has been one of restraint, except during the 1971 war. The chequered leveraging of this potent military instrument has been due to two aspects. The first is the worldwide inadequacy in the comprehension of the inherently complex and rapid technology-driven changes in air power’s characteristics and capabilities. The other is India’s traditional surface-dominant security outlook that stems from dealing with a primarily continental threat. Both these factors have led to the continued viewing of air power from the isolated lens of a support service to the continental and maritime domains, despite the long, consistent, and demonstrated commitment of the Indian Air Force to national security. With Asia as the crucible of the geopolitical churn in the world order, and the harsh reality of two adversaries with capable air forces on India’s unresolved borders, addressing the security challenges to the country require multi-domain expertise. A continued two-dimensional approach seriously impacts national security — along with narrowing India’s strategic outlook, it limits its response options. The IAF’s revised doctrine, therefore, underscores the necessity of a more holistic approach towards India’s security and lays out what aerospace can do to bolster it. It provides for a clearer understanding of the redefined characteristics of aerospace power and its expanded capabilities, not just with respect to contemporary and future warfare and conflicts, but also its place in fostering nation-building, strengthening regional security and contributing to India’s larger national interests. A pithy articulation of the Service objectives — evolved out of combat experience, invaluable assessments of international conflicts and its experience gained in international exercises — underpins the doctrine. A novel air strategy covers the entire spectrum of future aerospace applications: Apart from peace and war, this also includes the unique no-war-no-peace condition confronting the country. State-sponsored terrorism, increasing border stand-offs and internal security challenges make peace in India uneasy. Aerospace power helps shape security operations and external and internal security. Sovereignty protection, deterrence, air diplomacy and nation-building remain peace-time imperatives. The doctrine has the potential to accommodate major changes in wartime strategy that allow for the use of future precepts in the employment of aerospace power in the Indian security context. The doctrine’s focus on the criticality of controlling the skies — its absence in the Russia-Ukraine war has been conspicuous — is a justified imperative for India’s future joint military strategies as adversarial air powers will make all battle spaces highly contested. The IAF’s robust joint credentials, demonstrated in every conflict, remain a dominant flavour in its wartime air strategy, which flows out of the joint military strategy, and is laterally connected with the land and maritime strategies. Offensive air operations and air defence, the two indispensable pillars of air power, create the conditions for the holistic application of combat power, comprising the IAF’s coordinated operations along with army and naval operations. All of IAF’s enabling, enhancing and sustaining operations, underpinned by air mobility operations, directly and indirectly, contribute to the combined application of combat power. IAF’s only conduct of strategic air operations was in the 1971 war when critical high-value targets of West Pakistan’s vital energy system comprising its oil tanks, refinery, gas plants, and communication systems — including road, rail and bridge networks — were targeted with devastating effects and strategic outcomes. While the resulting acute shortage in fuel stocks forced the enemy to resort to imports, IAF’s sustained attack on the Pakistan army’s communication networks significantly dented the latter’s ability to fight, contributing to the failure of its much-vaunted offensive plans. This vital aspect of IAF’s offensive capability, which seeks to strike the enemy’s strategic and high-value counter-force and counter-value target systems deep inside the adversarial heartland. The impacts on the enemy’s politico-military will and ability to wage war have been given significant doctrinal salience. With the expansion of battlespaces beyond the traditional air, land, and sea domains, and the necessity of a multi-domain approach in India’s future joint military strategy, battle space transparency, combat networks, cyber and electronic warfare, information warfare and the vital techno-logistics constitute the foundation of IAF’s future air strategy. Since doctrinal reviews are undertaken regularly to keep pace with the rapid technology-driven changes in air power tactics and concepts of operations, human resources, training, and operational testing and evaluation remain priority doctrinal precepts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Shangri La speech of 2018, where he talked of working “with others to keep our seas, space, and airways free and open” and “equal access under international law to the use of common spaces on the sea and in the air,” doctrinally underpins IAF’s commitment to the larger political objectives of the nation. By exploiting its rapid force projection capability, enormous soft power, and international outreach in assisting statecraft and diplomacy, the document underscores the IAF’s inevitable and increasing role in the strategy for security and growth for all in the region (SAGAR), as well as in the larger Indo-Pacific construct. Though the domain of future aerospace power lies primarily with the IAF, the doctrine acknowledges that other services — civil aviation and space agencies — also contribute to this strength. Despite the air and space continuum, IAF’s multitude of space-based dependencies and applications, and the future necessity of aerospace defence of India’s space assets and ground-based infrastructure, the document refrains from asserting ownership of the arena. It maturely acknowledges that future aerospace and defence capabilities, related R&D, and associated civil-military industrial capabilities are national force multipliers. Since national security is every citizen’s concern and given the efforts underway to evolve national defence and security strategies, the doctrine credibly conveys what aerospace power has, can and will do for the nation, and the need for greater awareness of it.",      
    "Topic58": "The Collegium system for appointing judges has been under attack by the government. It is also the case that this system has a tenuous foundation in law. The legitimacy of the system, such as it is, rested entirely upon institutional practice and the trust that, all things considered, this system was likely to produce a judiciary that was both more independent and of higher quality. The trust in the Collegium system had been frittered away over the years by the manner in which the judiciary conducted its own affairs. The Supreme Court put itself in a position where doubts could easily be cast both on its excellence and its independence. But there was still a residual trust in the judiciary as the lesser of two evils. But the conduct of the Supreme Court over the appointment of Justice Victoria Gowri is yet another spectacular own goal. The issues in this case should not be seen in the context of a particular individual. Let us, for a moment, put aside the question of whether Justice Gowri is worthy of appointment. Instead, focus on the institutional dynamics at play. The first is an odd structural situation where the Court becomes a judge in its own cause. It is true that the petition challenging the Justice’s appointment was heard by judges who were not part of the Collegium. But this is, as Gautam Bhatia has forcefully pointed out, a case of the Court sitting in judgment of its own decision, where the bench is constituted by the Chief Justice who is party to the decision. This is a total legal anomaly, to put it mildly. The second issue is the question of what facts about a potential appointee are placed before the Collegium and the process by which it is done. If it has the power to recommend appointment, it has to have all the means and process to ensure that full due diligence is done on the candidates. Yes, sometimes honest mistakes can happen. But in this case, if the Court was confident of the procedures by which it vets candidates, there was no reason to for it to go through the motions of a hearing challenging the appointment. The drama of a hearing has more of an appearance of a charade. If it was not confident of its process then it needs an honest reckoning with how it vets candidates and assesses competence. There is something revealing about the passive construction we put on the Court’s grounds for conducting a hearing in this matter. The ostensible grounds are that certain facts might not have been placed before the Court. This is an admission of sorts, that the processes may not be designed to actively seek out all the relevant facts. Either way, the Collegium looks bad. But it gets worse. The Court admits a challenge to the appointment, but then put the presiding judges in an impossible position. First of all, it is not clear what a judicial review of suitability of a candidate might actually mean. Would judges more junior in the Collegium be now put in a position to pass judgment on their seniors? And what is the legal yardstick of suitability here? And then, to make a mockery of the process, the bench cannot be constituted before the judge has been administered the oath of office. So the judge will have to be removed by a process of impeachment anyway. So what is all this about: A hearing that is meaningless, has no serious judicial basis, and whose outcome is foregone? Is this tangled web a product of carelessness or complicity? Who can tell? But it is certainly a very odd way of the Court trying to secure legitimacy. But this is part of a pattern. Take another appointment issue, the elevation of Justice Saurabh Kirpal. Again, focus on the institutional issue. The Court is right to insist on his appointment if they are convinced he is a suitable candidate. It is also vitally important for the Court to insist on the principle that he cannot be denied appointment on grounds of his sexual orientation. But the Law Minister was not entirely wrong in suggesting that there is something odd about the Court making public the material contained in the IB report. The Court should be free, and ought to reject IB reports. The IB cannot have a veto, nor is it the final word on any official’s suitability. The Court could have simply said it does not find the IB report convincing. But to reveal its contents sets up a terrible precedent. It violates the confidentiality that defines the meaning of this process. I may, for instance, reject a confidential referee’s report as not being well argued. But I cannot undermine the process of confidential refereeing by revealing its contents. I sympathise with the urge in the Court to stand by a candidate who, on the face of it, is being wronged by the system. But the effective way to do it is not to gut the protocols, especially when it is unnecessary for achieving the objective. Do other candidates recommended by the Collegium but not appointed by the government also acquire now the right to find out whether their IB report was fair? Again, the Court may be taking the right position but with some potentially self-undermining grandstanding. There is another issue here on which there is all-round bad faith. We have no justiciable standards for what makes a suitable judge. How much should a potential judge’s writing or political activity before their becoming a judge be taken into consideration? A blanket rule saying all that is irrelevant will seem as unsatisfactory as a rule giving them undue credence. What form of speech is merely political and what shades into hate speech? What is a potential test of impartiality? And we know in so many cases, judges reveal themselves after the fact, as it were. There is, in all these matters, no option but to exercise all-things-considered judgments. It is illusory to think that there can be design fixes or rules that will do the job. The tragedy of this case is that the Collegium has lost trust on all counts: Its processes and its sense of judgment. The Supreme Court has undermined its own legitimacy at the worst moment possible, where even those opposed to the executive are wondering what the Collegium is up to.",      
    "Topic59": "Coming on the heels of the 2023 Union Budget and policy announcements by major central banks across the world, the monetary policy committee’s recent announcements have probably erred on the side of caution. In choosing to hike rates, while remaining committed to the withdrawal of accommodation, the MPC may have reached the end of the path it has been on, paving the way for a sustained period of growth. Interestingly, the RBI has now raised rates by 250 basis points over six policies. Contrast this with the interest rate hike of 375 basis points by RBI post the global financial crisis, which was spread over 14 policy statements. Clearly, the RBI has been remarkably nimble and ahead of the curve this time around. And the decline in inflation is there for everyone to see. In line with the wider market sentiments on increasing interest rates marginally to reach the terminal rate, RBI has also pegged growth at 6.4 per cent and inflation at 5.3 per cent for 2023-24. The sharp upward revision in the first quarter GDP estimates for 2023-24 to 7.8 per cent reflects the benefit of a significantly benign inflation rate during the quarter – WPI is expected to turn negative in May and June 2023 while CPI is likely to fall to less than 4.5 per cent in April 2023. A prolonged period of economic uncertainty — the spillover from global events — has not been able to dent India’s bright prospects. The announcements in the budget need to be seen from this perspective to get meaningful insight into the scheme of things as they unfold. The capital expenditure to GDP ratio is now at an 18-year high. The revenue deficit to fiscal deficit ratio is at a 17-year low, as is the subsidy to GDP ratio. These are remarkable fiscal changes, which global investors should take notice of. Central banks in emerging markets now seem to be cornered by the aggressive stance of the US Fed (through the federal funds rate), which makes taking a contrary monetary policy stance in these troubled times a difficult proposition. With the US job market continuing to remain resilient, as the latest data shows, it is now increasingly likely that the Fed will continue its rate hike even beyond March in its war against inflation. Against this background, there is now a need for more active debate on the timing and sequencing of the monetary stances by countries around the world, specifically for emerging economies. The exit from the current policy should differ across countries, depending on the risks to growth and price stability. Many are currently pricing in rate cuts by the Fed beginning in late 2023. However, other explanations for monetary policy actions in developed economies need to be factored in. For instance, since the early 1980s, the behaviour of asset prices has posed a continuing concern for central banks in their formulation of monetary policy. The upcoming monetary policy statement of RBI in April thus assumes special significance on whether it can signal an exit from the coordinated monetary policy increases so far. Not doing so could mean that central banks in emerging economies will continuously play catch up with the US Fed. Since April 2020, we have found that synchronised rate actions have resulted in increased market volatility, with spreads between the two jurisdictions declining. Non-synchronous monetary policy action in 2023 is, therefore, warranted for lower volatility. In the current cycle, deposit rates have been more aligned with the benchmark rate, while lending rates have witnessed softer transmission. This also reflects in the strong credit growth that we have seen in the recent post-pandemic period across all verticals. The next year should witness strong credit demand from established as well as sunrise and emerging sectors as formalisation and financialisation gather steam through policy measures and regulatory forbearance. But, we also need to ensure that credit growth continues to be buoyant, an effective enabler of which could be pricing. Fortunately, there are also other enablers of credit growth. India would, on conservative estimates, need somewhere close to $10 trillion in related investments to achieve its commitments to attain net zero by 2070. Thus, the role of banks becomes extremely significant to achieve incremental investments, and for setting a broad framework for recognising and addressing suitable risk-related parameters for financial entities will be sacrosanct to ensure markets evolve gradually. Additionally, steps taken towards cash-flow based financing, streamlining receivables receipt and easing the funding constraints of MSMEs, aligning TReDS with solutions to bolster MSME financing should go a long way in giving a fillip to lending to MSMEs. Lastly, India’s G20 presidency also opens new vistas of partnering with like-minded countries and offers us some great platforms to leverage our technological leadership in niche areas like UPI, RuPay and DBT mechanisms, which are being hailed as export-quality digital public goods for the world. The seamless integration of UPI with various payment mechanisms and its readiness to onboard CBDC (retail) should get a fillip through proposed endeavours across G20 countries. Considering all these positives, on balance, the projections bias among certain foreign institutions towards India’s growth estimates is perplexing, to say the least – from sliding towards one extreme to giving into irrational exuberance, and then at times falling into an abyss of unjustified pessimism. A balanced level-headed assessment is required in these uncertain times.",      
    "Topic60": "Today (February 10) is two years since India vacated the commanding heights of Kailash Ridge, surrendering its trump card in Restoring Status Quo Ante (RSQA) May 2020 in East Ladakh. On February 11, 2021, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh informed Parliament that an agreement had been reached that will “substantially restore status quo May 5, 2020, and achieve complete disengagement at the earliest. Talks between senior commanders within 48 hours of disengagement will take place to resolve remaining issues including resumption of patrolling”. Neither has happened, as fresh facts are available. Operation Snow Leopard on the South Bank of Pangong Tso, executed by Tibetans of the elite Special Frontier Force (SFF) on August 29-30, 2020, took the PLA by complete surprise. The lightning seizure of Chushul Heights on the Kailash Range, with tanks deployed at Rezang La and Rechin La, was described by the then Northern Army Commander Lt General Y K Joshi as a “gamechanger”. Simultaneously, a brigade occupied the Fingers area on the North Bank about which little is still known. Joshi said operations were intended for “unlocking disengagement” frozen since the Galwan clash and creating a bargaining lever for RSQA May 2020. By August 31, the SFF was built to brigade-strength but troops did not cross the LAC, as they should have, to occupy Black Top and Helmet Top, which the PLA seized along with the gaps between SFF positions. At places, Chinese tanks came within 30 to 50 metres of Indian tanks. Between August 29 and September 7, four firing incidents occurred, but mostly with no casualties. On August 31, Army commanders and government officials engaged in the war room to prevent an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation escalating to war. Joshi described the situation as being on the “brink of war”. It seems military commanders preferred to de-escalate and withdraw, while government mandarins opposed it, as this would forfeit the military advantage. Until now, it was not known who in the government “blinked first”, given the Army tenet, “no blinking and no brinkmanship”. Joshi justified withdrawal from Chushul Heights as it was not an “advantage in perpetuity”. Obtaining PLA withdrawal from Finger 3 to east of Finger 8 was equally imperative as was the removal of the Chinese flag and “China” written in Mandarin, both seen as an embarrassment. Chinese withdrawal was interpreted by Joshi as a “loss of face” for China. But trading Chushul Heights for the Fingers area squandered a strategic advantage in securing RSQA. Indian troops were seasoned and weather-hardened from decades of deployment in high-altitude Sikkim, Siachen and Ladakh. Between September and February, both sides offered their plans for withdrawal — India demanding complete disengagement and China resisting strongly. Finally, the Joshi formula to trade Chushul Heights for the Fingers area prevailed. Troops remained deployed till February 10, 2021, when disengagement started. Despite Joshi’s fear of escalation, the key reason for vacating Kailash Ridge, the SFF held ground for five months. The Chinese reneged on their promise to resolve all remaining friction points during talks held within 48 hours of disengagement. The pullback from Gogra occurred in August 2021 and Hot Springs in September 2022, leaving two critical offensive launchpads for India at Demchok and Depsang unresolved and blocked by the PLA. On July 15, 2021, it was reported that the PLA had flouted the demilitarisation agreement of February 2021 and reoccupied Black Top and Helmet Top, preempting Indian return to these heights. This report was neither confirmed nor denied by the government. Former NSA Shivshankar Menon observed: “We don’t know what happened on the South Bank as we know about the North Bank.” After its disengagement from Hot Springs in September 2022, the PLA said that it “will not accept the status quo of May 2020 created by India illegally crossing the LAC”. Last month, MEA officials told me that having surprised us on the ground, the Chinese joined the talks from a position of “power and strength”. The officials admitted that transgressions (not intrusions/incursions) are due to “overlapping perceptions” regarding LAC and the government insisted there is no loss of territory. They added: “No military breakthrough is likely and RSQA May 2020 is a pipe dream. DMZs will continue as new patrolling arrangements are minted (a relevant fact presented in last month’s DGP’s conference is that India had lost the use of 26 of 65 patrolling points between Karakoram Pass and Demchok). We don’t see any grand bargain like India accepting the DMZ for China recognising the McMahon Line. The problem of graziers is likely to be resolved by each side escorting their graziers.” The mandarins said that summit-level diplomacy is unlikely even as India will hold the presidency of the G20 and the SCO where President Xi Jinping is likely to come. Clearly, the government will continue with the gag on Ladakh, including about the folly of vacating Kailash Heights, and cover it with the glow of the G20 presidency for which it sought a one-year deferral. Like Balakot, PM Modi requires another Snow Leopard to unlock the status quo and restore deterrence.",      
    "Topic61": "The growing distrust between the government of Tamil Nadu and its governor found its way from the Assembly to twitter last week when #GetOutRavi trended. Representatives of the DMK subsequently met the President of India to submit a memorandum on the issue as well. For his part, Governor R N Ravi, first, stirred up sentiments by speaking about the name of the state and then went on to omit portions of the Governor’s Address to the legislative assembly. Given that the interference of governors in non-BJP states is at an all-time high, it will not be long before like-minded regional parties come together on a federal platform to review the role and scope of governors within the constitutional scheme itself. It is conventionally inconceivable and constitutionally impermissible for any governor to suggest a name change for the state. As an unelected nominee of the Centre, the governor is expected not to be involved with political controversies let alone ideologies. Convention dictates that the occupants of Raj Bhavan display statesmanship, not one-upmanship. The state of Madras became Tamil Nadu through the due legislative process — a unanimous resolution passed by the legislative assembly and legislative council in July 1967. Upon receipt of this resolution from the state government, the government of India introduced legislation to alter the name of the state from Madras to Tamil Nadu and enact necessary changes to the First and Fourth Schedules to the Constitution. By casually proposing a change to the state’s name, Ravi has displayed ignorance of the constitutional processes as well as disrespect towards the will of the state legislatures and Parliament. The Governor’s Address given under Article 176 of the Constitution of India, much like the President’s Address to Parliament, is a formal statement given by the government to the legislature to initiate a discussion among the members of the Assembly. It is nothing more than a curtain-raiser speech on the progress made over the past year and the policies of the government for the upcoming year. It is now settled law that the governor has no discretionary powers and this has been laid down by the Supreme Court (SC) in the landmark case of Shamsher Singh vs State of Punjab, (1975). The Court, then, held that governor is only a short form for government. Ergo, the courts have consistently held that the constitutional scheme does not make available any powers to the governor to act beyond the aid and advice of the council of ministers. Any scenario where the governors exercised discretion in their official functions would lead to disastrous consequences. A politically-active governor would give rise to a usurpation of the power of elected representatives. This is alien to our constitutional scheme of Cabinet responsibility. In the past, courts have been slow to interfere with the functions of those occupying high constitutional offices. Nebam Rebia vs Deputy Speaker (2016) saw a definitive shift with the SC holding the governor’s actions unconstitutional. There is an ideological war brewing to define the constitutional architecture of the country. The fight is essentially between ideologies that preach a conformist, unitary structure and those movements which stand for federalist principles. In many other states, especially Opposition-governed ones, governors have wantonly indulged in extra-constitutional transgressions. It is urged by some that the governors enjoy sovereign immunity and as such, no time frame can be imposed on their functioning. However, in Keisham Meghachandra Singh vs Hon’ble Speaker (2020), the SC issued a mandamus to the speaker to dispose of disqualification petitions within a strict time frame. Similarly, in A G Perarivalan vs State (2022) reiterated, the SC exercised its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to effectively step into the shoes of the governor and commute the sentence of the convicted prisoner. As such, governors would be well informed that an active judiciary can always issue directions when constitutional authorities have failed to act in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time. Time may have now come to rethink, review, and revamp the role of governors within our evolving jurisprudential framework to suit modern constitutional morality.",      
    "Topic62": "It’s not as though the Bos taurus didn’t have enough symbolic weight on her shoulders. She is, according to the Centre’s Animal Welfare Board, “the backbone of Indian culture and rural economy (sic)”. In fact “Kamdhenu” and “Gaumata” — these are among the many terms of endearment — “sustains our life, represent cattle wealth and biodiversity”. Now, imagine the plight of the poor cow. After a hard day of grazing, holding up “Vedic traditions” and being a real and symbolic mother across species, she is accosted by hordes seeking to extract more “emotional richness” and “individual and collective happiness”. What no one is asking is this: Has anyone asked the cow? The Animal Welfare Board’s “appeal” asking people to celebrate February 14 — perhaps not coincidentally, Valentine’s Day, the day marked out for marketing love — as Cow Hug Day does not suffer from a logistics problem. A day before the notice was issued, the Uttar Pradesh government announced the creation of a cow sanctuary, a pilot project to house stray cattle. And proposals for “cow safaris” have cropped up now and then over the last few years. A cow safari can be an exciting experience for those with great imaginations, even though for others, it might bring up traumatic memories of traffic jams. Getting off and hugging the animals, then, may be a way to boost these endeavours as well. Like so many mothers, real and symbolic, must the cow quietly take on these several burdens — emotional, economic, social and even civilisational — with no “me time”? It’s unlikely to be pleasant, being hugged and smothered by strangers. Perhaps the greatest gift the tired, overworked and overused animal can receive is a break from needy kids.",      
    "Topic63": "In the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s designated seat in the Rajya Sabha has been shifted from the front to the last row. The change was reportedly made to allow him more space to manoeuvre his wheelchair. The senior Congress leader’s mobility-related issues could well be age-related. But the change in his Upper House seat has once again brought into focus a glaring deficiency in India’s buildings and public spaces — inaccessible toilets, wheelchair-unfriendly architecture and chaotic roads mean that going to work, attending educational institutions and meeting friends is a daily struggle for the country’s disabled. According to the 2011 Census, India has about 27 million people with disabilities — about 2.2 per cent of the country’s population. Experts reckon this to be an undercount — a large number of people do not report their disability due to social stigma and many people with special needs fall off the radar because of the ableist bias of the surveyors. In 2015, the government embarked on the Accessible India Campaign (AIC) to create a “barrier free environment and for independent, safe and dignified living” for this section of the population. The programme targeted the built environment, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem and the public transport system. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act of 2016, which came into force a year later, stated that “all public buildings shall be made accessible” to the disabled by 2021. At that time, experts had warned that the failure to set up a robust enforcement and monitoring mechanism could jeopardise the infrastructural upgrading envisaged by the AIC and the Disabilities Act. Their apprehensions seem to have come true — the 2021 deadline has been breached. According to Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment data, less than 50 per cent of government buildings and barely 8 per cent of public buses in the country met the Disability Act’s requirements in December last year. Enabling initiatives for the country’s disabled have consistently drawn criticism for being trapped in the charity paradigm. In 2017, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court said that the approach of such programmes should be geared towards providing a level-playing field for “people with special needs”. It underlined the importance of sensitising authorities and the public at large. Initiatives to create environmental sensitivity in urban areas are examples that awareness and sensitisation drives work. Rainwater harvesting structures and green building norms, for instance, are now part of the playbook of large segments of India’s construction sector. The conversations over shifting a former PM’s Rajya Sabha seat should lead to this long overdue sensitisation.",

Elusive Phoolan Devi: The growing confrontation between the police of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh over the elusive bandit, Phoolan Devi, reached a flash-point when they clashed in Jalaun district. The Jalaun police have arrested an inspector and five constables of Bhind kotwali and seized their jeep and firearms when they were allegedly “kidnapping” the close relatives of Man Singh, paramour of Phoolan Devi, whose father, mother, brother and three sisters had already been whisked away from Shekhpura village.

    "Topic65": "India has made the right call by sending rescue and relief assistance to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that has killed thousands in the affected areas of both countries, more on the Turkish side. Amid the frighteningly high toll, it is only right that all members of the international community pitch in with help to the best of their ability. It is in keeping with India’s best tradition of being an early responder to natural disasters and calamities in its immediate neighbourhood, and of late, in other parts of the world as well. While Delhi has stepped in with assistance frequently in the South Asian region, it also reached out with relief supplies and teams from the National Disaster Relief Force and medical teams to Japan during the 2011 tsunami, and to the United States in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. This time, too, teams of Army medics and personnel of the NDRF along with medical supplies have been sent to southern Turkey, and to northern Syria. While assistance in the time of need, especially when such massive disasters strike, can be seen as a natural response to a crisis, humanitarian aid is part and parcel of every nation’s diplomatic toolkit, and especially for those with resources. It reaffirms friendship, seeks to project leadership and influence, and in relation to countries that do not have friendly ties, could prove to be an icebreaker. India’s shipments of Covid vaccines to several countries across the world, and rushing to help during crises in the neighbourhood, whether in the Maldives, Sri Lanka or Nepal, were also assertions of India’s leadership of the region and a statement of its global aspirations. During the 2005 earthquake that hit both sides of the Line of Control, and the 2010 floods, India contributed to UN fund-raisers for the country, getting around bilateral barriers, signaling willingness to move forward. The other side of the coin is aid refusal. During last year’s floods that ravaged Pakistan, Delhi conveyed a readiness to send assistance, but Islamabad did not respond, and thereafter, India did not contribute to the UN’s international fund. In 2004, the Manmohan Singh government refused international aid, bilateral as well as from international aid agencies, sending a message that an economically resurgent India has the ability to cope with crisis on its own. Over the last four years, Delhi had virtually cut off Turkey for its pro-Pakistan posturing on Kashmir, but realisation set in soon enough that a globalised world creates interdependencies in unexpected ways and no country can isolate another without hurting itself. In 2021, Turkey was among the countries that sent oxygen supplies to help India fight Covid’s Delta wave. Turkey is also a world logistics hub and several Indian companies are based there. Last September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation summit at Samarkand in Uzbekistan. Turkey’s effusive thank-you to India — “a friend in need is a friend indeed”, said the Turkish Ambassador in Delhi — reaffirms that both sides are working on the relationship.",      
    "Topic66": "India either really has collective amnesia, or just pretends to have it. Which is why the heckling of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge in Rajya Sabha for wearing an expensive Louis Vuitton scarf not only comes across as facile but betrays a wilful ignorance of comparative contexts. Why does the ruling BJP forget that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who may be wearing a vest made of recycled bottles today, has earlier worn a bespoke pinstripe suit with his name woven into the fabric? Why can’t a Dalit leader also make a fashion statement while beating a seasonal cold? Maybe it is just the buttonhole-the-Opposition syndrome. This seems to be a battle of perceptions, based largely on optics, that the Opposition is far from winning: Be it the Congress or the Trinamool Congress’s Mohua Moitra, who created quite a stir by carrying an LV bag during a discussion on price rise. There is a point to the silliness of the tirade against Kharge — to divert attention from the demand for a JPC probe into the Adani-Hindenburg issue, with din, mindless chatter, inane humour and social media memes questioning the Congress’s moral right to represent the masses. Perhaps the plan is that by the time the troll army gets done with making a ruckus about Kharge’s scarf, the little effort that the Opposition makes as a united entity in forcing a national agenda would have got reduced to a footnote. As a Congress leader, Kharge has earned the right to sport a Louis Vuitton scarf. After all it was his party that brought in liberalisation, which in turn brought the globe to us and built aspirations. In fact, when Louis Vuitton entered India, with accessories and scarves, the company spokesperson was very clear that it was targeting the aspiring working class professional, who could make a brand statement with the smallest of items. Last heard, many upwardly mobile professionals had saved up enough to buy an LV bag, purse or a scarf, making these items more seen than talked about. With knockoffs blurring the divide, owning an LV scarf is not a big deal anymore. In the power capital of Delhi, in particular, you can find many wrapping one around their neck to stay warm in winter. Why can’t Kharge, who has worked his way up from grass roots politics in Karnataka, wear the scarf if he can afford it? Winning elections consistently, enjoying the faith of the people and without being dogged by any major controversy, he has been known to plough back resources to his constituents. Has anybody wondered why Kharge’s sartorial choices were never commented upon till the day he adorned a branded scarf? Always seen in desi wear, nobody ever extolled the virtues of him wearing the fabric of the people. Does that mean that the man, who has remained true to his labour leader origins, is not qualified to wear anything else? There seems to be a casteist and classist bias when it comes to Dalit assertion and ascension. Perhaps the privileged, while professing equality, are uncomfortable about new realities. Maybe Kharge became the target of the day because he represents all that is devalued in politics these days. He is an avowed secularist, having lost his family to communal riots. He is a rare political survivor, who has lost only one of the 12 elections he has contested, and is a dogged contender in the electoral sweepstakes. As a polyglot and a patron of arts, Kharge has a more liberal and accommodative spirit than many of his ilk can claim to have. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonwalla tweeted, “Taste apna apna, message apna apna. PM Narendra Modi sends a ‘green message’ with his sustainable fashion — blue jacket; enlisting Jan Bhagidari for the cause of sustainable growth and environment. Meanwhile, Kharge ji sports an expensive LV scarf.” But, in a true democracy, shouldn’t it also be about “andaaz apna apna”?",      
    "Topic67": "The past year was unprecedented for India in terms of environmental protection in many ways. India’s pledge to have net-zero emissions by 2070 was one of the most important moves towards its resolve to fight climate change. Anthropogenic emissions are central to environmental issues, whether climate change or air quality. During the peak winter months of November to January in 2022-23, air quality in India’s financial hub, Mumbai, noticeably deteriorated — a taste of what Delhi encounters frequently for Mumbaikars. Out of the past 92 winter days, Mumbai observed 66 poor and very poor air quality days in 2022-23 as compared to just 28 in the past three years’ average. More so, it had just one day in the permissible limit (NAAQS) this year as against the average of 15 days in the recent past. So good days declined, but foul days have increased by a whopping 135 per cent, leaving residents more choked and breathless than they have been in years. On many days during these months, the air quality in Mumbai sank lower than in Delhi. These findings are from India’s first indigenously-developed forecasting framework, SAFAR, an initiative of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences. It follows a robust and rigorous scientific methodology that conforms to sitting guidelines established by the World Meteorological Organisation. Mumbai is one of four cities in India that has air quality forecasting and advisory services, while other cities are yet to begin as mandated in NCAP. What caused this unusual development? Air quality deteriorates mainly due to emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources, and weather manoeuvres. The weather or climate cannot generate emissions. Some cities like Delhi have a disadvantage due to their geographical location, being landlocked. But Mumbai is a coastal city that enjoys a natural cleansing advantage. Stronger surface winds favour faster dispersion and wind reversal cycles of strong sea breezes that sweep away air pollutants from the land. However, there have been indications in recent times that nature can take away the blessing it bestowed. Scientists have discovered that climate change is leading to extreme weather, changes in the ecosystem, and human displacements, but linkages with air quality remain elusive. The reason for the sudden spike in the current pollution cycle in Mumbai is part of a larger meteorological phenomenon that needs to be studied further. My research suggests that the unprecedented triple dip in La Nina, attributed to climate change, has played an unusual role. This phenomenon has led to the change in wind patterns affecting Mumbai, with frequent calmer wind spells, and delayed cleaner sea wind reversal around the region. This, in turn, affects the natural cleansing mechanism of the city by reducing the dispersal rate of pollutants and trapping the newly generated high-flying dust emissions. The import of transboundary pollution from more polluted regions due to wind pattern changes is also adding to the misery. An increase in all sizes of particles (coarser and finer) has been observed. It is scientifically prudent to conclude that the major share in the current worsening of air quality is from dust emissions. Many redevelopment and construction projects are operational across the city. So, the increase is due to intensifying emissions at the source, which usually consist of PM 2.5 (Particulate Matter) – made up of transport (31 per cent), industries (20 per cent), and resuspended dust (15 per cent), besides other smaller sources. Before we start to address the problem, we need to recognise it. The debate on relocating ambient air quality monitors in the city to cleaner or more polluted locations is merely a form of avoidance. After all, wherever they are located, a Mumbaikar is breathing foul air. Acting together and strengthening the fight against air pollution should be the order of the day. The situation is not currently urgent, but it is a clear early sign of the impact climate change can have. Hence, we must address the root cause of the problem — anthropogenic emissions — instead of looking for shortcuts. The battle against air pollution is long and difficult, but success is achievable beyond doubt. Putting green curtains around construction sites, regularly sprinkling water on truck tyres and debris before loading and unloading material, and ensuring smooth traffic flow to overcome snarls are some of the immediate remedies. In the medium term, transitioning to electric vehicles, addressing solid waste management, dumping grounds, and industrial toxin management are some actions that will help us achieve better air quality.",      
    "Topic68": "Gandhiji once said, “Life and death are but phases of the same thing, the reverse and obverse of the same coin. Death is necessary for man’s growth as life itself is.” To Tagore, the journey was “let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death be like autumn leaves”. Shanti Bhushan, affectionately called Shantiji, was independent India’s most courageous lawyer. He always stood on a high pedestal, espousing honesty in judicial life. He not just spoke, but fought against corruption in public life, exposing Indira Gandhi or P V Narasimha Rao, even former Chief Justices of the Supreme Court. An outstanding and hugely successful lawyer, a respected Advocate General of UP, an active Law Minister, a crusader on public issues of great significance, Shantiji lived the most fulfilling life. As a lawyer, he was totally self-made. Starting his practice in Allahabad, he acquired a respectable name in a short time and then having started practice in the Supreme Court after 1980, he became a leading lawyer. Commanding thriving practice on varied subjects, he also commanded a very high standard in fees. But he was one of the hardest working lawyers one could encounter. Every page of his brief would be read carefully and marked diligently. Never did he enter a courtroom without thorough preparation. Extremely soft spoken outside the court, he was effective inside with a resounding, and at times booming, voice. His sheer presence had an impact on all – the judges, the lawyers and the litigants. If he could at times be tough with judges, with the opposite lawyers he was always courteous and calm. Outside courtrooms, he was hilarious, regaling one and all with very funny jokes and courtroom stories. One could not reconcile that this was The Shanti Bhushan. He loved the judiciary in his own way and strongly believed in its independence. His crusade against corruption and nepotism in the institution was due to that love. He was the most ardent admirer of honest and bright judges and the most feared critic of the corrupt and the inefficient. While facing possible contempt proceedings, Shantiji told the Supreme Court, “The applicant will consider it a great honour to spend time in jail for making an effort to get for the people of India an honest and clean judiciary.” He had many interests in life. He was a voracious reader, a crazy cricket fan and an avid golfer. He constantly talked about India’s democracy, its challenges and pitfalls, on public platforms and travelled across the nation to do so. He was a constant teacher to the young Indians, especially the lawyers, inspiring them to follow the right and courageous path. He successfully argued the election case for Raj Narain against Indira Gandhi before Justice Sinha of the Allahabad High Court. During hearings, he strongly rebuked the then Attorney General’s casual attack on the Supreme Court judgement in the famous Kesavananda Bharati case which held that Parliament could not amend the basic structure of the Constitution. He argued, “If I may say so, with respect to my learned friend, his attitude towards this historic judgement of the Supreme Court was unworthy of the office he holds. So long as the decision continues to be binding, what can possibly be the relevance of the Attorney General ceasing to attach importance to that decision.” Such powerful words spoken in 1975 are resounding even today. Shantiji believed that “a country is great when it worships principles and not men”. He also felt the “glory of justice lies in being based on principles than on any other trivial considerations”. He was a true Indian, someone Sahir Ludhianvi was searching for in his famous song “Jinhe naaz hai Hind par woh kahan hain, kahan hain, kahan hain”. Shantiji’s life was a great journey full of joy, hard work, courage, passion, humour and success. Most of all, standing up to defend the Constitution of India and the institutions created under it. Before committing suicide as directed by Emperor Nero, his teacher Seneca said, “I leave you what is of far more value than earthly riches, the example of a virtuous life.” Shantiji has been a real example. The legal fraternity has in recent years become poorer and poorer, losing great lawyers one after another. Today, it loses its North Star. Let us hope his life continues to light the path for future generations of lawyers. Sans that democracy will perish.",

Till now it was more of a novelty — great to tout but rarely of any actual use. Still, the biggest indicator of its impact might actually be in the bad news that’s been coming out of Silicon Valley around the same time. The layoffs announced by almost all the tech giants recently in a way underline how a lot of what they have been pivoting towards might actually have been rendered redundant by advancements in AI. And you will see more of this happening over the next few years as companies realise that it’s easier to let computers figure out some problems than let people struggle to find the solutions. The new buzz around AI is mostly thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot which can handle most queries humans throw at it. But what it does is not really new. It has just become better at its job. And even then it still cannot match what human intelligence is capable of. For example, if you ask the bot about a certain person, with a very common name, the chances are it will give you a response mixing the profiles of multiple people with the same name. That’s because it still has a lot to learn. And it is learning. A good example of this is when you ask AI a common maths problem or riddle. If its first answer was wrong, chances are that it will have found the right answer by the time it is asked the same question for the second or third time. And this is the great difference between AI and conventional tech – the former’s ability to get better without human intervention. The first big battle for AI, it seems, will be fought in the area of search where Google seems to be worried about how the new technology, which it helped build to a large extent, will challenge its own monopolistic business model. Microsoft seems to have an edge now thanks to its collaboration with OpenAI and just-announced integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into the Bing search engine and Edge browser. Google preempted the announcement from Redmond, the Microsoft headquarters, by saying that it will also integrate Bard, a conversation AI layer, into its search. We still don’t know how users will take to either of these, but it will certainly change the way people see search results, which will now be a synopsis of sorts, instead of a list of options for them to choose from. This AI-driven move from choice to curation will impact many businesses from publishing to e-commerce, as users will no longer have a real reason to click on anything to satiate their curiosity. But then search itself will be challenged in its ability to be a destination for millions of users because AI can potentially give users what they want wherever they are. For instance, your query about a flight option can be pulled right into the mail you are writing to the office travel desk. Students will be able to do their research right inside the word processor file without leaving that app for a second.Then there is the larger question of the sanctity of the data and knowledge that these models are training themselves on. While AI platforms crawl news websites and other sources to learn, whatever they curate out of this will always include a certain degree of plagiarism. While platforms like Neeva are already citing the sources of their information, not everyone might be that careful. This becomes an even bigger issue when you look at AI-generated art where every creation, from paintings to music, owes its origins to someone else’s work, but without any credit. The litigation floodgates could open and that is why some platforms think it’s better to just create or buy the content from which the models are creating new art. These are turbulent times and we don’t really know where we will end up. After all, AI has been called a technology as powerful as electricity in its impact. Yes, it will cost millions of jobs and business models as it rolls out over the next few years, but will also create new ones and make many lives better in the process. But for now, it does not seem to be powerful enough to make humans redundant.",      
    "Topic70": "Union budgets can be understood in two ways. The first is as a standard accounting exercise of the government’s revenues and expenditures. Over the years, this has ceased to be a good metric with governments failing to spend what is announced in the budget. While the practice of off-budget entries is now no longer relevant, even revenue projections are much less reliable. But the budget continues to remain relevant as the most important and perhaps the only comprehensive economic document of the government. It is this second aspect that provides insight into the government’s assessment of the challenges facing the economy and ways to overcome them. These challenges are now obvious with the economy having been through the “Great Indian Slowdown” between 2016-17 and 2019-20 and the pandemic, which followed it. While the fog of the pandemic has disappeared and the associated supply bottlenecks have eased, it is premature to conclude that the economy has fully recovered. Per capita incomes in real terms in 2021-22 are still below the 2018-19 levels and the overall growth between 2016-17 and 2021-22 is at its lowest level of 3.7 per cent for any five-year period in the last four decades. The fact that the economy was slowing down before the pandemic makes it clear that Covid only exacerbated the already fragile economic situation. The structural factors that led to the slowdown remain, as in the last three years the government’s efforts were directed towards managing the pandemic. The most important of these is the decline in demand, both for consumption and investment. Private consumption accounts for almost 60 per cent of the economy and this engine of growth has failed to fire. The distress is far more serious in rural areas. Rural wages have stagnated for almost a decade now. Farmers’ incomes have either declined or, at best, stagnated in the last five years. Given the state of the rural economy, the obvious strategy for the 2023 budget would have been to find means to enhance rural incomes. What has been done is the withdrawal of expenditure on almost every head that mattered for rural economic recovery. The budget for the agricultural sector is lower than the allocation last year. In real terms, the budget has declined by 10 per cent at a time when the agricultural sector is going through its worst crisis. The rise in input costs for both energy and fertilisers is likely to get worse with the withdrawal of the fertiliser subsidy. Even the nominal cash transfer that was provided as part of the PM-Kisan has seen a decline in allocation. But then, this budget is no different from others in the last five years. Perhaps the best indicator of the government’s apathy towards the rural sector is seen in the actual investment in agriculture. Public investment in agriculture declined by 0.6 per cent per annum between 2016-17 and 2020-21, the last year for which data is available. This is a period when the agrarian economy has suffered its worst crisis of profitability. The non-farm sector is now greater in terms of its contribution to the rural economy but has seen a decline in budget allocations. The budget for the Ministry of Rural Development, at Rs 1.57 lakh crore, is 13 per cent lower than the revised expenditure last year and even lower than the Rs 1.60 lakh crore in 2021-22. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) has seen its budget decline to Rs 60,000 crore as against Rs 89,400 crore in the revised estimates for 2022-23. Even though MGNREGA wages are only two-thirds of the private market wages, the high demand for work under the scheme is ample proof of the crisis of jobs and earnings in rural areas. This is the lowest amount allocated in the last five years compared to actual expenditure on the scheme. The only scheme that has seen an increase in allocation is the rural housing scheme, from an actual spending of Rs 48,422 crore in 2022-23 to Rs 54,487 crore. With spiraling inflation and even the cushion of free foodgrains having been withdrawn, rural areas are likely to face an uncertain situation. With the distress in the rural economy spilling over to urban areas and in particular the urban middle class, there were expectations that at least the latter will benefit from the budget. Not surprisingly, the only thing they got was a carrot to shift to the new tax regime, which has failed to take off even after two years of implementation. On the other hand, there was something tangible for the super-rich with a reduction in tax rates. The impact of these is unlikely to spur demand from the middle class, much less from the super-rich. None of this is surprising given the government’s preference for supply-side interventions even when there is excess capacity in a demand-constrained economy. It is this understanding that is reflected in an almost one-third increase in allocation for investment. A bulk of this is in railways and roads – a much-needed boost to the infrastructure sector. But given the small share of public investment, it is unlikely to be sufficient unless it is accompanied by the private sector increasing its investment. The track record in this regard has, unfortunately, not been very good with the private sector neither responding to rising public investment nor tax subsidies, as were given in 2019. This will have a negligible impact on employment and domestic demand given the low employment elasticity of these investments. Regardless, the increase in investments is welcome. But if this has been achieved at the cost of sacrificing demand, can it revive the economy? This was the last full budget in which government could undertake serious steps to revive the economy. That required prioritising allocations towards reviving consumption demand, spurring private investment and protecting people from the vulnerabilities of high inflation and a slowing economy. The budget does none of this. The problem with this budget is not accounting but economic policy. It may have done well on the first count but certainly failed as the policy document for economic recovery and sustaining the Indian growth story.",      
    "Topic71": "The word, “Atmanirbhar” is usually thought of as related to the concepts of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Limiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of “Atmanirbhar” to this understanding would, however, not do complete justice to his vision. To get a comprehensive understanding of Atmanirbhar — the thinking and the processes and programmes associated with it — one needs to appreciate the idea, not just from the current context. It is also important to look at the country from a historical and civilisational lens. India has historically been known for innovation and intellectual accomplishments — in governance, spiritual thought, education, healthcare, industry, trade and several other fields. Centuries of colonisation and invasions created a sense of inferiority amongst people in the country, led to intellectual stagnation and fostered a slavish mentality amongst Indians at the time of Independence. When the British left Indian soil, they did not just leave us with political freedom. A large section of Indians continued to think and behave like the subjects of a benign crown. For most Indians of that generation, becoming a citizen was a novelty and demanded a change in beliefs, values, and practices. While it is easy to be dependent on a benevolent state, becoming a free thinker and operating with the spirit of citizenship requires conviction, discipline, determined optimism and hard work. This is possible only when there is an ecosystem that promotes self-respect and self-belief. Unfortunately, for several decades after Independence, the ecosystem in the country did not nurture adequately the idea of engaged citizenship — people continued to look at the state as the “provider”, leaving a large section of Indians feeling unsure about their capabilities. This is no longer the dominant narrative today. Today, a generation of young people are qualified, competent and confident in deciding not just their future but that of the nation as well. This needs to be seen in the background of how India’s position in the global comity of nations has been enhanced over the last few years. This visibility and respect for India and what Indians are capable of must be seen as an outcome of the several visits PM Modi has undertaken to different parts of the world. Whether it is evacuating Indians from conflict zones, or the Vande Bharat missions, from taking over the G20 presidency to a seat at the UNSC, we can see how the ecosystem has been spreading the feeling of pride and self-sufficiency. Moving towards self-reliance from the historical dependencies of the past several decades is more than just a paradigm shift. It needs to change the mindset of not just citizens, but also of the political class and the bureaucracy. Programmes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Startup India, Standup India, Yoga Day celebrations and Ayushman Bharat not only reinforced the reasoning that Indians must look to themselves for making the country clean, healthy and economically independent, but they also boosted national pride. These programmes nurtured Atmanirbharata in their own ways. No nation can progress without engaging its citizens in the development process. Citizenship is not just about participating in the electoral process. It is also about enlightening oneself with information, engaging with the state and its agencies and operating with a sense of empowerment. This is possible only when the government and prevailing political leadership play a catalytic role and create spaces for citizens to confidently operate. The last few years have seen a growing movement towards getting people to participate in different aspects of governance. Whether it is the MyGov platform, the Prime Minister seeking inputs from the people for his annual Independence Day speech, or the finance minister asking for suggestions from the citizens for the annual budget — one can see the openness and desire to reduce information and power asymmetries. From the growing trust in the government and its several agencies to identifying persons for the Padma awards, one can see the feeling of Atmanirbharata seep through the collective consciousness of the masses.All this points to a significant political development — the evolution of Indians from being subjects to citizens. Today the world is seeking answers to myriad problems — social, political, economic, environmental, international relations, global trade, healthcare, education, skiing. The Atmanirbhar experiment and the lessons that India is learning today as a nation can help usher in a new model of sustainable development. A world where equity, fairness, justice, dignity and citizen engagement are no longer fashion statements, but a way of life. Swami Vivekananda spoke about a new India rising, where he saw her sitting on a resplendent throne as the “Jagatguru” to humankind. India’s Atmanirbhar programme is not just about India’s progress or development. It has much to do about humanity. Once a nation like India, with all its challenges, learns to unleash the potential of its citizenry and share this knowledge with the rest of the world, several other nations will emulate it and follow the path of peace and progress.",      
    "Topic72": "Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman needs to be complimented for taking a bold step to reorient support in the agri-food-rural space from doles towards development. Assembly elections are slated for nine states this year and the Lok Sabha elections will be held in about a year’s time. The FM has, however, resisted the temptation to announce freebies. Instead, she has proposed a growth oriented, asset creating and inclusive budget to develop better infrastructure and create more productive jobs. She has proposed a drastic cut in food and fertiliser subsidies, and also reduced the expenditure on MGNREGA in 2023-24 compared to the revised estimates (RE) of 2022-23. Together, these cuts amount to roughly Rs 1.7 lakh crore . But does this mean that the FM has wielded an axe on agriculture and rural spending? The simple answer is “no”, because the savings from these doles have been redirected towards more productive expenditures on railways, roads, rural housing and Jal Shakti — this will help rural India through its multiplier effects. Take the case of Railways. Its capital outlay is up 48.6 per cent at Rs 2.41 lakh crore in 2023-24, from the revised estimate of Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2022-23. Road transport and highways has a capital outlay of Rs 2.70 lakh crore in 2023-24 against Rs 2.17 lakh crore in 2022-23 (RE). This clearly reveals the government’s focus on Gati Shakti to reduce the cost of logistics. Logistics and supply chain costs account for around 12 per cent of the GDP in India compared to the global average of 8 per cent. Improving connectivity through rail, road, air and waterways will surely improve the competitiveness of Indian products, including that of agricultural produce in global markets and also help in taming inflation. This is a well thought out strategy and will pay the country handsomely in the years to come. Another critical asset creating expenditure is on the PM Awas Yojana (Gramin). The overall outlay for PM Awas Yojana has increased to Rs 54,487 crore, up from Rs 20,000 crore that was budgeted in the 2022-23 budget — a net increase of 172.4 per cent. However, if one compares the 2023-24 PMAY-G outlay to the RE of 2022-23 (Rs 48,422 crore), which was already way above the BE of 2022-23 (Rs 20,000 crore), the hike in 2023-24 seems to be only 12.5 per cent. The scheme was launched in 2016 to provide housing to all but it also ensures permanent asset creation for rural households and provides dignity of life while creating more jobs in rural India. This marks a big step forward in reorienting subsidies towards rural infrastructure development.",      
    "Topic73": "Last week, the US and the EU banned the purchase of petroleum products from Russia. Two months earlier, on December 5, they had imposed a similar ban on Russian crude oil. At that time they had announced that any third-party buyer that paid more than $60/bbl for Russian crude oil would be denied access to Western insurance, finance and brokerage services. The ban on petroleum products will also be accompanied by a price cap, albeit at two levels. One level will be for commodities like diesel that sell at a premium to crude oil and the other for commodities that sell at a discount like fuel oil. The precise numbers have yet to be announced. The idea of a cap was first put on the table when the price of oil was in triple digits and Russia was earning more from its exports than it had earned prior to the Ukraine invasion. This was galling for the US as it negated the impact of the sanctions. The purpose of the cap was twofold. One, to keep Russian oil flowing into the international market. This is because Russia accounted for 10 per cent of global supplies and a complete cut off would send prices into the stratosphere. And two, to reduce Russian export earnings by pushing down production and compelling buyers to pay less than the international price. The price cap accompanied by the sanction was conceptualised to achieve both objectives. The former was above the average cost of production of Russian oil of between $ 25-40/bbl, and therefore, an incentive for Russian companies to continue producing. The latter complicated access to essential services and constrained, therefore, the trade and shipment of Russian oil. Ever since this idea was first mooted, I have wondered about its viability. For it is a well-known economic precept that administrative price (and income) controls do not work and that, if anything, they provide profitable arbitrage opportunities for wily traders. I am not one for conspiracy theories but I have asked myself why a world class economist like Janet Yellen would put her weight behind such an idea when in a different avatar as an economics professor, she would, most likely, critique it as a blunt and ineffective instrument. I have reflected whether the progenitors of this idea had objectives other than those publicly stated. Two months into this cap, I see trends — some unexpected — that give partial credence to my reflections. First, as was anticipated by all experts, the cap does not work. It contains too many loopholes. Thus, for instance, one easy way of circumnavigating the cap would be for the seller to state a price in the bill of lading at the port of loading that is at or below the cap price and then adjust it upwards vide freight and other charges. Buyers pay on the basis of the delivered price. More pertinently, Russia is rumoured to have gathered a shadow fleet of tankers to bypass the western insurers. Second, Russia’s production has fallen by between 800kbd to 1 mbd which is approximately 25 per cent of the country’s exports. This has reduced export earnings. But hardened traders are still transacting in Russia. Several have (re)registered their offices in countries that are not subject to sanctions like the UAE and have exploited the arbitrage opportunity to buy “low” and sell “high”. Third, the cut back in Russian crude (and products) has tightened the market. Prices are currently holding because winter has been relatively mild – the US has released more barrels from their strategic petroleum reserve than expected and the Chinese demand has been laggard. This trend might, however, reverse. Saudis and the UAE are not likely to draw on their surplus producible capacity to offset the gap created by the reduction in Russian exports. And China is determined to return to the high economic growth trajectory. If and when prices do spike, the progenitors of the cap might well find themselves hoisted by their own petard. Four, Saudi Arabia must be discomfited by the knowledge that a price cap has acquired shape and that the US may be tempted to apply it against them if prices ever reached politically uncomfortable levels. There are many reasons why the Saudis are looking to place their relations with the US on a transactional base and why India is regarded as an increasingly important strategic market. But one reason may well flow from this discomfiture. Five, Europe has been adversely impacted by the price cap. This is because they are disproportionately dependent on Russian crude and products. They have had to turn to the US, Middle East and India to meet their shortfall and in response the suppliers from these countries have redirected their cargoes to the European market at a premium. In an ironic twist, Indian refiners are sourcing crude from the eastern seaboard of Russia, shipping it to their refineries — predominantly in Jamnagar — and then moving the products, mainly diesel, to Europe. The extended trading distances have tightened the shipping markets. Tanker freight rates have ratcheted up and the stock price of shipping companies are close to historic highs. Finally, and perhaps the reason I used the word “conspiracy” earlier, US petroleum companies have benefited most from Europe’s plight. In a flourish of commercial opportunism, the US administration has allowed Chevron to return to their concessions in Venezuela but on condition that the crude oil produced by them will be sold only into the US. They have done this notwithstanding that they still do not recognise President Nicolas Maduro. This decision will allow US companies to convert a relatively inexpensive heavy crude oil into higher value added, lighter products like diesel for export at a premium to Europe. Combined with the fact that US LNG has already predominately replaced Russian gas, it would be no exaggeration to suggest that Europe has been pushed into a relationship of energy dependency with the US. The price cap has redesigned the contours of energy geopolitics.",      
    "Topic74": "The Union Budget has sharply reduced the outlay for MGNREGA in 2023-24 to Rs 60,000 crore. This provision for the flagship rural employment programme is the lowest in six years — as against the record Rs 1,11,170 crore in 2020-21, Rs 98,468 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 89,400 crore in 2022-23. The apparent rationale is the Narendra Modi government’s belief that the Indian economy has fully emerged from the ravages of Covid and even adjusted to the disruptions of the Russia-Ukraine war. The opening chapter of the Finance Ministry’s latest Economic Survey is, indeed, titled “Recovery Complete”. The normalisation of economic activity means no need for special safety nets — be it increased work-days under MGNREGA or additional free grain supply through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana —that helped protect the most vulnerable households from significant loss of incomes during the pandemic and after. 2023-24 should hopefully be the first “normal” year after 2019-20. Even while slashing the MGNREGA budget, the Modi government has hiked the allocations for the drinking-water Jal Jeevan Mission (from Rs 55,000 crore to Rs 70,000 crore) and constructing houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rs 77,130 crore to Rs 79,590 crore). Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in an interview to this newspaper, has pointed out that the labour required for establishing tap connections or building homes would come from the same people seeking work through MGNREGA. To the extent this will happen — over and above the work demand generated from resumption of labour-intensive manufacturing activity and contact-based services — there would be that much less need for MGNREGA. Moreover, the beneficiaries of assets created under the Awas Yojana and Jal Jeevan are going to be largely the rural poor themselves. Persuasive though the Modi government’s arguments are, they fundamentally rest on the assumption of normalcy returning or having returned already. In other words, no worsening of the war in Ukraine, no repeat of last year’s March temperature surge that decimated the rabi crop and a normal southwest monsoon. For now, the signs are encouraging — be it easing of global food prices, a pick-up in nominal rural wages’ growth or buoyant tractor sales since September. It’s equally likely that the Modi government is keeping the gunpowder dry for elections, both in major states later this year and the big national one in early 2024. Take the PM-Kisan scheme, under which over 11 crore farm households receive Rs 6,000 annual income support. Neither has that amount gone up nor its outlay, which has been retained at the 2022-23 level of Rs 60,000 crore. The electoral cycle could well be another normalcy-disrupting factor.",

    "Topic76": "Death is inevitable. However, a conscious acknowledgement of how close it is and living with that every day, is horrifically painful. It’s been over three years, and it still haunts me to think of the days I spent beside my mother in the chemo ward, and the constant conversations I had with doctors and other patients — many of whom seemed to have lost all hope. Spending time in the cancer ward of the hospital made me realise how dark and full of fear and uncertainty life is for the poor. My mother, now hale and hearty, a woman of massive willpower and determination, saw a long bout of chemotherapy spread over a year-and-a-half — all thanks to our “financial well-being”. But what about those who cannot even make ends meet? What about widowed women and those who have no one to look after them… or children whose parents are in a constant dilemma of whether to stay beside their sick child or seek one day’s labour to meet the treatment needs? Every time I visit a cancer ward, it’s more and more harrowing as I realise that even after all these years, it’s the same — the poor remain poor, plagued by the same financial crises and robbed of the fundamental right to health. The days and months that I scrambled around looking after my mum’s needs left me baffled in many ways. No matter where you are getting treated, be it a private or a government hospital, cancer treatment is only for the rich. Given how expensive medicines used in chemotherapy are, even oncologists keep it from the poor that there are drugs that can better one’s condition. In some cases, the patients themselves leave their fate in God’s hands. I remember my mother’s chief doctor saying, “Yes, you can afford it (drug); it’s just a matter of lakhs and it will be over soon… However, not many can and so we don’t inform them.” I have rejoiced at the fact that a single drug can do wonders for my mother’s health, but it also made me see how fragile our lives are without monetary support. Even when the doctors said they could only give a year for my mother, we at least had the drugs to pin our hopes on, believing that things could turn around. For my mother to improve from the last stage of cancer, going through 17 cycles of therapy, including chemo, hormonal and radiation and finally undergoing mastectomy, it has definitely been a hard-won battle for my family. But many people I met at the ward couldn’t even afford one-third of these treatments. The fact is that cancer treatment does not end with therapy; it is a constant fight, having to get checked every few months and staying on adequate medication all your life. Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and one in nine Indians gets cancer during their lifetime, according to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study. As per data from the National Cancer Registry of the ICMR presented in Parliament, deaths due to cancer have only increased in our country — from 7.7 lakh in 2020 and 7.9 lakh in 2021 to about 8.08 lakh in 2022. The figure is estimated to further increase to 15.7 lakh by 2025. We have been hearing how early detection and treatment could cure a majority of cancer patients. However, detection itself needs frequent hospital trips, which many, especially the poor, avoid to save on expenses. They live in the hope that the “swelling” is nothing but a “boil” that will go away in a few days. They only turn up when the pain is unbearable and they still have to make compromises. Even as reports of new drugs and therapy claiming effective impact raises our hopes, the question remains — who can actually afford it? Along with the physical effects, the mental toll it takes on the patient as well as the concerned family is devastating. The larger expense of drugs only adds to this, causing despair and anxiety. I always thought, if only cancer was just a thing for the rich and the influential — at least they could get better and even survive! This may sound naive, but if diseases have no boundaries, healthcare facilities should also know no limits and must be available and affordable to all. Our government needs to step up and extend a helping hand to the underprivileged as another World Cancer Day comes and goes.",      
    "Topic77": "The central government’s clearance of the five recommendations made by the Supreme Court collegium for appointment as judges of the apex court must put to rest apprehensions about an escalating conflict between the executive and judiciary on the issue of judicial appointments. The government’s response in the face of an emerging standoff between two pillars of the Indian state demonstrates that when put to the test, those charged with the working of the Constitution can rise to the occasion. This is a welcome respite for a nation fatigued by the cynicism and superciliousness of those charged with the duty to enforce constitutional edicts. Hopefully, the decision will foster comity between democratic institutions to collectively subserve constitutional goals and bring to an end the debilitating public spat between high constitutional functionaries on the subject of judicial appointments — at least till a broader debate yields a better result.Clearly, the outstanding issues that impact the relationship between the executive and judicial branches need to be constructively addressed in an environment free of mutual suspicion and distrust. While the collegium system of appointments is today the judicially-ordained law of the land and ought not to be tampered with, there should be no impediment to revisiting the extant mechanism in the light of experience. It also rests on the debatable premise that judicial independence, as part of the Constitution’s basic structure, is best secured only when the judges appoint judges. In fact, it is indisputable that some of the finest judges were appointed to the highest court before the judicial conception of the collegium. The present system’s stated purpose of ensuring judicial independence has blunted criticism of the judicial approach. Apprehensions of judicial overreach resurfaced when the NJAC judgment declared the related constitutional amendment as unconstitutional. A progressively evolving jurisprudence must permit a reconsideration of the present system of judicial appointments. In this process, the government and judicial branch need not be seen as adversaries — the Supreme Court has affirmed on several occasions that the three branches of the Indian state are expected to work together in facilitating the advancement of judicial goals. The challenge “to reconcile constitutional authority with popular sovereignty” is a perennial one. The debate that has begun afresh must contend with several questions. First, can the justification of the Court’s anti-majoritarian role be used to equate constitutional supremacy with judicial supremacy that is sought to be ensured through the finality of judicial pronouncements of the constitutional court? Can the mandate of the Court as the supreme judicial arbiter be located in its inferential deductions from the Constitution in the face of an expressed constitutional intent? These and several issues of critical importance for the future of our constitutional democracy are once again in the public domain. In navigating our course as a vibrant and accountable democracy, we need to find the right balance between competing jurisprudential preferences. In working out a compromise, the exercise of constitutional power ought to be informed by a spirit of “self-search and self-reproach”. It is possible for both Parliament and the Court to collectively serve as the nation’s “North Star” within the discipline of the Constitution. In drawing the “Lakshman Rekha”, the Supreme Court can be a “light unto the nation” even if it cannot be a “sheriff unto the nation”.",      
    "Topic78": "There is no populism in Union Budget for 2023-24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s fifth in a row, no foreshadow of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections – or its imperatives for a party working for a third term. If at all, this Budget clearly points to continuity to the government’s economic strategy. It is bold, and innovative too with the hope that good economics isn’t necessarily bad politics. The big picture of the Budget is its focus on growth through higher productive capital spending, and simultaneously sticking to fiscal prudence, which in the near to medium term will mean lower interest rates for the private sector, encouraging them to invest. Clearly, the emphasis is on capital investment, and the acknowledgement in North Block that the government must continue to be a player in spending, particularly when the private sector is still shying away from making big investments. In the last three years, capital expenditure has risen continuously – from Rs 4.39 lakh crore in 2020-21 to Rs 5.4 lakh crore in 2021-22 to Rs 7.5 lakh crore in the current financial year (2022-23) to Rs 10 lakh crore in the next financial year. The capital investment outlay for next year is 33 per cent higher than what is estimated for 2022-23. What is innovative in the Budget is a sharp nudge to taxpayers to move to the new tax regime. By bringing in some relief in terms of standard deduction to those opting for the new tax regime, she has incentivized individuals in the middle-income category. Further, she has raised the tax threshold to Rs 7 lakh a year from Rs 5 lakh a year. This will again prod those in the lower tax bracket to switch. Further, lowering of the surcharge on the super-rich (those earning Rs 5 crore or more a year) such that the effective tax rate is lowered from 42.7 per cent to 39 per cent, will immediately incentivise the super-rich to shift to the new tax regime.",      
    "Topic79": "The DMK government’s proposed move to construct a ‘Pen monument’ in honour of the late M Karunanidhi’s literary contributions to Tamil language has caused a stir. The monument, which is expected to be taller than the Thiruvalluvar statue in Kanyakumari, has garnered attention for its design and location – a giant pen standing in the waters of the Bay of Bengal. However, beyond the controversies and politics surrounding the Rs 81-crore project, the story behind the ‘pen’ deserves attention. The monument was conceived to represent the many facets of Karunanidhi’s literary work. Karunanidhi, who passed away in August 2018, belonged to a rarefied group of scholar-politicians. Most importantly, Karunanidhi’s scholarship came from outside the formal education system. Yet, he managed to find his feet and establish himself in both scholarship and politics. The late M G Ramachandran, or MGR, a former chief minister and matinee idol who founded the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), is often compared to Karunanidhi in the context of politics. Though MGR was never considered an orator or writer, he was able to use his success in the film industry to build a clean image in politics. Karunanidhi, on the other hand, took a different tack, choosing to project the image of a literary scholar and politician who stayed by the written word throughout his life. When compared to many of his contemporaries, Karunanidhi stood out as a remarkable orator because of his firm grasp on political and cultural history. His skill as a writer came from his contributions to three foundational dialects of the Tamil language — Iyal (poetry and literature), Isai (music), and Naadagam (theatre). Karunanidhi’s image as a scholar-administrator was shaped largely due to his mentor and DMK founder C N Annadurai, who, unlike Karunanidhi, had formal education. In Karunanidhi’s early days, and even after Annadurai’s death, political circles in the state were abuzz with the striking similarities between the two. Karunanidhi strove to copy his mentor in all possible ways while projecting himself as Annadurai’s legitimate heir – from the way he shifted his shawl from one shoulder to another, to the way he looked left to right during speeches, and the art of speech modulation that saw him generating a voice that was throaty and uneven (“Kara Kara”, in Tamil), yet clear and audible. While he gained his mentor’s mannerisms and scholarship, Karunanidhi did not follow Annadurai’s simple life or the latter’s high standards in keeping his family out of politics.Though Karunanidhi never matched Annadurai’s fluency in English, he admired his mentor as a scholar and communicator, with the pen being a major artefact in his life. Karunanidhi never used typewriters though they were popular when he was at the height of his film career. He preferred writing and is known to have bought his ink pens from a certain shop in Chennai. He was an avid writer, someone who is remembered for the 7,000-odd letters he wrote. His used these letters, which appeared in the DMK mouthpiece Murasoli, to reach out to his followers, just the way Annadurai did through ‘Dravida Nadu’ publications. He is known to have worked hard on these letters – each rich in data and facts and steeped in anecdotes and poetry – while making the job of his private secretaries difficult. Karunanidhi was known to be a haphazard writer, someone who wrote largely at home, sitting up in his bed, a pillow kept near his chest that propped up his notebook. Those who have known him say he used to sweat considerably when writing, “Even when the air conditioners were turned on”. He would be so engrossed in his writing that he often failed to notice the pages that slipped off his writing pad. “When he writes, there is a pin-drop silence, so much so that one can hear the noise of the nib scraping the page. He was the quintessential writer,” a close aide of Karunanidhi recounted to The Indian Express after his death. Not only were his literary works and speeches considered political art, so were his file notings that were often flowery and poetic. A colleague recalls how as Chief Minister, when a file on raising the retirement age of government personnel came to him, he wrote: “Puthiya Pookkal Malarattum (Let new flowers bloom)”. When there was a commotion in the state Assembly over the birth of Kanimozhi, his child from his third wife, with someone pointing out that a child with the name ‘Kanimozhi’ was born in a Madras hospital and cornering Karunanidhi over who Rajathi Ammal, the child’s mother, was, his response was: “she is my Kanimozhi’s mother.” In 2007, an intelligence officer called on Karunanidhi in the Assembly and handed him a note written in Tamil to inform him about the attack on the Dinakaran office in Madurai. “He read it and started editing the note, pointing out grammatical errors, before returning it,” the officer recalled. Karunanidhi’s plays were mostly political, his novels were about regional history, and his poems were passionate, theatrical and strong. Following Annadurai’s death, he wrote a long and emotional poem, which was published in the Murasoli. The poem, a powerful tribute to his leader, was widely used in DMK meetings after Annadurai’s death. The poem, which ended up being a vehicle for Karunanidhi to emerge as a successor to Annadurai and become CM, is an example of how Karunanidhi made use of his literary skills to climb the political ladder. Ponnar Sankar, Sanga Thamizh, Thirukkural Urai, Thenpandi Singam and his autobiography Nenjukku Neethi, Iniyavai Irubathu, Kuraloviam, Romapuri Pandian and Vellikizhamai were among the many poems, essays, scripts, and publications he produced. Ponnar Sankar, a story set in Kongu Nadu, or western Tamil Nadu, was based on local heroes. His screenplay for Poompuhar (1964), based on Silappathikaram, was likewise well-received. His screenplay and dialogues for Raja Rani (1956) are unforgettable, particularly a scene in which Sivaji Ganesan delivers a powerful monologue for about five minutes, in a single take. Karunanidhi, along with V R Nedunchezhiyan and K Anbazhagan, are personalities whose names are often cited as examples for how Annadurai inspired his followers. Did Karunanidhi similarly inspire his followers? Except for a handful who imitated his oratory skills, after Karunanidhi, there were few who emerged as a scholar-politician like him.",      
    "Topic80": "The Adani crisis dominated headlines last week, so the release of Siddique Kappan barely made the news. After more than two years in jail the release of this journalist from Kerala deserves more attention. It is shameful that in a democratic country someone should be imprisoned this long without being charged with a crime, leave alone convicted of one. And yet, ever since a law made for terrorists was tweaked by the Modi government, it has been used regularly to keep people who are not terrorists in jail indefinitely. Among the activists, student leaders and journalists who have spent months and years in jail without being convicted of a crime is the JNU student leader Umar Khalid. He has been in prison since 2020 without trial. What is very worrying is that the misuse of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the equally draconian Prevention of Money Laundering Act is now so normal that it attracts little media attention. It is these two laws under which Kappan has been jailed since October 2020. He was arrested on the way to Hathras because the Uttar Pradesh government was keen to prevent journalists from reporting on the horrific gangrape, murder and hasty cremation of a Dalit teenager. The girl’s upper-caste rapists broke her back while trying to strangle her with her own dupatta, but she lived long enough to identify the men who did this to her. When her broken body was brought to her village after she died in hospital, the police cremated it in the dead of night without last rites or dignity. It was this story that Kappan was going to Hathras to investigate. He never got there. He was arrested on suspicion that he was travelling with jihadists from the Popular Front of India (PFI). At the time of Kappan’s arrest the PFI had not been banned and even if his travelling companions were jihadists, he himself was a bona fide journalist. As he said when he was released last week, ‘Journalism is not a crime.’ It is because of the Modi government’s reckless use of anti-terrorism laws to arrest people who are not terrorists, that international democracy watchdogs now put India in the category of partial democracies. It is ironical and inexplicable that the Modi government continues to misuse anti-terrorism laws because not since Indira Gandhi has an Indian prime minister been as conscious of world opinion as Narendra Modi. This year India’s leadership of the G20 has given him the chance to use it to project himself as someone who is going to set not just India’s agenda but the agenda of the world. One of the posters advertising the G20 summit has a picture of our Prime Minister with the message that India’s ambitions are bigger than its temporary leadership of the G20. Has Modi forgotten that most major countries in the G20 are democracies who respect India for her democratic values? Modi is deeply sensitive to criticism in the western media but appears to have not discovered that if journalists, dissidents, and students spend months in jail without trial, he will inevitably be seen as an autocrat. When he is called an autocrat his army of spokesmen and supporters are deployed on social media to rave and rant about western plots against India. Would it not be simpler for democratic norms to be followed by the Modi government so that our democracy does not keep being downgraded? Dissidence is brutally crushed only in countries that have no pretensions to being the ‘mother of democracy’. So why is this not more obvious? Our criminal justice system is rightly criticized for moving so slowly that alleged murderers, rapists, and terrorists spend years in jail awaiting trial. It is estimated that more than 80% of prisoners in Indian jails are those who remain untried and this undertrial population has grown since the UAPA was amended in 2019 to widen the definition of terrorism. The amendment enables the government to decide who a terrorist is and then evade the need to prove this in court for as long as it feels like. This is how the process of justice itself becomes the punishment. Does this sound democratic? India has earned the respect of the democratic world because we have managed somehow to keep the light of democracy shining through times of great trouble and turmoil. Modi has personally declared that India is the ‘mother of democracy’ although it is to Greece to whom this honour really belongs. So, does he really want history to remember him as the Prime Minister on whose watch democracy was diminished by branding dissidents as terrorists and locking them up for long periods? Siddique Kappan should not have had to spend two years in jail. Umar Khalid should not be kept in jail without the government proving in court its charge that he was the ‘mastermind’ of the Delhi riots. The question I ask myself as I write these words is whether either of these two men would have suffered such long periods of imprisonment if they had been Hindu and not Muslim? I know the answer, but I ask the question because it is something you should all be thinking about as India steps into what Modi’s spokesmen like to call our Amrit Kaal. In this celebration of our seventy-fifth year of Independence, we must cherish our greatest asset. Democracy.",      
    "Topic81": "One is relieved that India has avoided what has happened in the country’s neighbourhood —Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Having looked at the past seven budgets, Ursula K Le Guin’s words ring true: “There is a certain bleakness in finding hope where one expected certainty.” With elections to the state assemblies and Parliament slated over the next year or so, the Union budget was expected to be populist within the constrained fiscal circumstances. It does far more. In layman’s terms, how do the budget allocations impact farmers? Indian farmers pay Rs 266.50 per bag of urea with a subsidy per bag of Rs 2,317. For DAP, they pay Rs 1,350 per bag with a subsidy component of Rs 2,500. Farmers generally use five bags of urea and two-and-a-half bags of DAP per acre for a wheat-paddy crop rotation. Therefore, they are subsidised to the tune of Rs 17,840 per acre. Their Pakistani brethren pay 2.5 times this amount. The BJP IT cell could have saturated the online conversation with this positive narrative, but it was busy creating ghosts. This has resulted in the FM being compelled to make compromises. Yet, it would be worthwhile to ask if India is going wrong somewhere. On my field trips across the country, I asked farmers and landless workers if 75 years of budgets, agriculture policies, support and subsidies have empowered them to lead a life of dignity. The answer is always a vehement “no”. Governments provide humongous sums (over Rs 8 lakh crore) under PM Kisan, free electricity, subsidised fertiliser and minimum support price procurement. It is not that India has not progressed or these subsidies have not helped but, after 75 years, something is seriously amiss. The answer, which curiously even farmers seem unconscious of, is that most subsidies are only a “pass-through” to consumers and cash transfers are a simplistic fix for inherently complex issues. There is also confusion when it comes to apportioning blame. The Centre receives flak for lack of delivery of services and promises that are actually within the ambit of the states. At the state level, the capacity to deploy resources rationally — to scale up and execute programmes — remains abysmally low. Thus, one simply cannot forecast the future by poring over the Union budget in isolation from what will happen at the state level. Ideas like reviving the “old pension scheme” and providing “free electricity” can only hasten bankruptcy in the states that resort to such measures. The other worry is the booming debt — at the Centre and state levels — which the budget fails to stem. In fact, India’s debt is growing faster than the economy as a whole. Till some time ago, the conventional wisdom was: Budgetary allocations can be made on the premise that quality of life can be equated with consumption. But that is now being questioned. Budget 2023 seems to be aware of this shift. Allocations for 11.7 crore household toilets under the Swachh Bharat Mission and enhancing the outlay for PM Awas Yojana by 66 per cent to Rs 79,000 crore are welcome steps. As a farmer, one is excited about the Atmanirbhar Horticulture Clean Plant Programme to boost the availability of disease-free, quality planting material — the programme has an outlay of Rs 2,200 crore. The budget makes a good effort but considering the size of the farm sector, the allocations are minuscule, even for programmes to incentivise natural farming, using animal manure and shifting to alternative fertilisers. Contrary to expectations, the FM has decided not to increase the quantum and ambit of PM Kisan to farm labourers. The bigger worry is on the employment front. The government has failed in filling government job vacancies and generating employment. I do not foresee the creation of mass employment fast enough or raising of incomes, except for government employees. The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana that aims to skill 4 lakh youth within the next three years brings to mind Lao Tsu’s words, “The truth is not always beautiful, nor does beautiful word the truth”. The words “green” and “energy” occur several times in the budget speech. They raise apprehensions that the funds will be spent on industrial-scale projects for converting food to fuel — a terrible proposition. The green transition is better achieved by incentivising electric tractors, charged with on-field solar panels and giving farmers the choice of being off-the-grid or with a net-metering facility. Out-of-the-box thinking seems to be missing from the budget. For those wondering if the budget will move the needle one way or another, one can only advise a portion of blind faith. The decade is still not lost. As a farmer, one is an optimist, as farmers usually are. Despite all the reasons for pessimism, there is hope that the worst is behind us, though one does not really know what lies ahead. The economic reality is catching up with this regime and it is time the lion lost sleep over the opinion of the sheep.",      
    "Topic82": "An all-rounder in cricket adapts to conditions and steps up as the situation demands, be it in bowling or batting or exceptional fielding. In many ways, the government and the finance minister have burnished their credentials as all-rounders and delivered as the situation demanded. When India was going through the pandemic, the government deviated from the fiscal deficit glide path and supported the economy, through one of the biggest food subsidy and vaccination programmes in the world. Then, when the situation demanded a step up in investments in infrastructure, the government stepped up its capital spending. This budget was the first such exercise post the pandemic. There were worries about changes in the tax regime for capital markets or it being overtly populist. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has chosen the path of prudence. The headline numbers – growth expectations of revenue and expenditure at around 11 per cent — are credible. The fiscal deficit at 5.9 per cent of GDP of FY 24 appears to be in line with market expectations. So does the Centre’s gross and net borrowing programme. The government has once again underlined its commitment to the fiscal glide path, projecting to bring down the deficit to 4.5 per cent by FY26. Given its recent track record, this glide path is credible and something for bond markets to rejoice. The budget has been progressive, growth oriented and resisted the urge to go populist. Its focus has been on maintaining the growth momentum with a clear push on infrastructure. The total receipts of this year have been revised substantially to Rs 23.4 trillion in FY23BE. It seems that the FM believes in the philosophy of “under promise and over deliver”. The nominal GDP growth estimate, at 10.5 per cent in FY24, looks conservative. The total revenue receipt growth assumption at 12 per cent and the gross tax revenue growth of 10 per cent in FY24 also looks realistic on the back of strong GST collections and growth in corporate India’s earnings. The government continues to maintain its thrust on capex with more than Rs 10 lakh crore budgeted for FY24. To visualise how large capex this is – the Centre’s capex as percent of GDP in decade from 2010-2020 average just 1.7 per cent. This number has now increased to 3.3 per cent. There is some relief on the personal tax front as well. The tax foregone as a result of the changes announced in this budget would be to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore, effectively this is a surplus transferred to the consumer. The tax slab for senior citizens has been raised and a special savings scheme has been introduced for women. The government has also removed many tax arbitrage instruments. This includes life insurance policies which had tax concessions and market-linked debentures, effectively an equity product, which was earlier taxed as a fixed-income instrument. The government has also created an incentive for many to move to the new tax system – one with limited exemptions and where assets are invested on their core merit rather than just an avenue for optimising for tax outgo. This reduces the scope of misallocation of capital in the long-term. There has been continued thrust on the last-mile delivery of public goods – drinking water, cooking fuels, and housing (where the allocation has gone up by 66 per cent). It is also heartening that the budget signals the government’s desire to engage with the tourism sector on a “mission mode” – tourism is a significant economic multiplier on job creation, foreign exchange receipts as well as infrastructure. The government has also announced an Rs 35,000 crore capital subsidy for the transition to clean energy as part of its efforts to reduce the country’s dependence on current fossil fuels. MSMEs have received support as well. This includes the infusion of an additional Rs 9,000 crore and a revamped credit guarantee scheme that can potentially increase collateral-free guaranteed credit by Rs 2 lakh crore. The government has also announced that 95 per cent of the performance guarantee amounts in contracts of MSMEs that were impacted by the Covid19 pandemic will be returned to these firms. The markets were apprehensive about changes in the tax structure on capital gains. These fears have been allayed. The budget has played a fine balancing act and delivered to its core constituencies. It has tried to seize near-term opportunities and is also alive to the need to address long-term priorities. From an equity market perspective, no negative news is good news. Over the last few months, markets have seen correction and the premium that India commands has contracted vis-a-vis other emerging markets. While the valuations are still punchy, the structural growth levers of India, along with competent management teams of India Inc, imply that corrections will be bought into, especially by longer-term investors.",      
    "Topic83": "What are the main highlights of the budget in the agri-food space? If I had to sum it up in just two words, I would say “revdi restrained”. Let’s look at some of the key figures. The food subsidy in the FY24 budget is estimated (BE) at roughly 1.97 lakh crore against the revised estimates (RE) of FY23 at Rs 2.87 lakh crore. This means a net saving of roughly Rs 90,000 crore. This has been done by discontinuing the earlier PM-GKAY (Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana), which was started during the Covid-19 period by giving an extra 5 kg of grain free to more than 81 crore people. This has been stopped from January 1. Instead, PDS supplies under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), for which rice and wheat were being charged Rs 3 and Rs 2 per kg, are now made free — this has been renamed as PM-GKAY. Now, let’s look at the other, second-biggest subsidy – for fertilisers. In the BE of FY24, it is provisioned at roughly Rs 1.75 lakh crore as against the RE of FY23 at Rs 2.25 lakh crore — a saving of about Rs 50,000 crore. This has been made possible primarily by the lower costs of imported fertilisers and gas, as the global economy has absorbed the shock of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Hope this does not go out of hand in FY24. On top of these two major subsidies, the BE under PM-KISAN for FY24 has been kept at Rs 60,000 crore, the same as the RE of FY23. Recall that this scheme was announced in the run-up to the 2019 parliamentary elections. Rs 6,000 was to be given in three tranches of Rs 2,000 each to more than 11 crore farming households. Since then, the nominal amount has remained constant. With inflation over the last four years, this has actually eroded in real terms by about 20 per cent, if not more. Farmers have been pressing for raising the amount to at least Rs 8,000 per family, but the Finance Minister (FM) has shown restraint. However, one never knows what will happen by the end of the year — the compulsions of electoral politics could force the Modi government to raise the amount to Rs 8,000, perhaps even more. In any case, right now, savings from these subsidy schemes will help the FM to rein in the fiscal deficit to 5.9 per cent, as budgeted for FY24. It is commendable that the RE of the fiscal deficit in FY23 has remained at 6.4 per cent of the GDP, as was provisioned in the budget. Reducing the fiscal deficit further — to 4.5 per cent by 2025 as the FM says — would be a great achievement, especially when she has increased the overall capex in the economy by more than 30 per cent. That only shows a sense of rationality in restraining revdis and focusing on growth. If India can remain on this path for a few more years, it can outshine many of its peers in the G20.",      
    "Topic84": "Being the last full budget of the current BJP led-government, people had high expectations but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman dashed all such hopes. The Union Budget 2023-24 turned out to be nothing but a bag of deceptions. It is a ruthless budget, with no announcements or benefits for the youth, farmers, labourers, women, Scheduled Tribes and the poor. The budget fails to address measures to check inflation and generate employment — these were the need of the hour. It has been prepared keeping an eye on the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. The finance minister’s claim of understanding the pressure on the middle class turned out to be a political gimmick, as no immediate and concrete measures were announced to provide relief from the rise in prices. The common citizen, who is reeling under price rise, was hopeful that the government would put forth some measures to help them keep more money in their hands by reducing GST on essential items and providing some necessary sops. But the real problem remained untouched. The government just played around with big figures and tried to appease people with attractive names for schemes. The budget lacked focus on issues like the impact of the global slowdown on economic growth and attaining improved health and educational outcomes. Even the government’s much-applauded move of changing the tax slabs and increasing the income tax rebate to Rs 7 lakh in the new tax regime is a blow for the salaried class as there is no provision of exemption under 80 C in it. It only discourages the savings required for the social security of an individual in the long run. The decision will dent the insurance sector as well, affecting the jobs of insurance agents. The highest tax slab has been reduced, giving direct benefits to a few top political influencers. The budget does not address the rapidly rising unemployment rate. The allocation for MGNREGA, a key factor in stimulating the economy of the state as well as the country, has come down by 33 per cent, proving that the budget is anti-poor. The central government paid no heed to the states’ concerns and demands. Chhattisgarh’s demand for the release of GST compensation, central excise dues and the transfer of coal royalties fell on deaf ears. The coal royalty rate was also not increased this year. It was last increased in 2014. No new trains, as demanded, were given to Ambikapur, Jagdalpur and Surguja. The government had promised to double the income of farmers by 2022, housing was to be available to every poor person, and the unemployed were to get 60 lakh jobs. The finance minister should tell us how many of the promises made by the government in the last budget were fulfilled. Agriculture contributes 14-15 per cent of the GDP but there was not a word in the budget on the government’s intention to legalise minimum support price (MSP) or on providing guaranteed income to farmers. The Centre has now launched the Gobardhan scheme to make use of cow dung. This step is a mere emulation of the Chhattisgarh model. Chhattisgarh has been successfully implementing the Godhan Nyay Yojana for the last two years through its gothans and purchasing cow dung at Rs 2 per kg. The implementation of the Godhan Nyaya Yojana in a phased manner has created sustainable growth in the rural economy of Chhattisgarh. Farmers are preparing vermicompost, their dependence on chemical fertilisers has reduced and the income of women associated with this scheme has increased. The problem of stray animals causing huge damage to crops was also not talked about in the budget. The budget has nothing concrete about alternative energy, despite the skyrocketing prices of CNG, petrol and diesel. It mentions that the focus is on biogas and green growth in 2023-24, but Chhattisgarh has been continuously seeking permission for ethanol production from paddy, which is still pending. This year has been declared as the International Year of Millets, but MSP on millets was not talked about in the budget. In Chhattisgarh, on the other hand, we have declared the support price for 52 crops.",      
    "Topic85": "In a pre-election year, there were wide expectations that the Union Budget would announce populist measures, which could impact the fiscal deficit glide path. However, the budgetary announcements ticked all the boxes by balancing the wider expectations of tax relief to individuals with sufficient resources for various government schemes. Adherence to the fiscal deficit glide path and market borrowing in line with expectations led to a rally in bond prices and a decline in the yield on government securities. This is expected to provide some relief to the debt markets and prevent any near-term crowding out of private borrowings from the debt capital market. From the financial sector’s point of view, the budget continued to focus on further enhancing the public market infrastructure. Various announcements such as the setting up of the National Financial Information Registry, a continuation of fiscal support for digital payments and digitalisation of documents for MSME lending or computerisation of agricultural cooperatives were some key positives. Further, in a bid to improve ease of doing business, the announcements to carry out a comprehensive review of existing regulations by various financial sector regulators will significantly ease the compliance burden on various participants. With a few recent failures of banks and governance issues around others, the budget also proposed amendments to the Banking Regulation Act to enhance investor protection and governance structure in the banks. We will also be watching out for the amendments related to the government’s shareholding in public banks as a precursor to the expected privatisation of these banks. The above measures are expected to have a significant positive impact on the financial sector in the long term. However, certain measures such as the continuation of the credit guarantee scheme for MSME lending and continued thrust on affordable housing are likely to support credit off-take in the near term. Further, setting up a new subsidiary under EXIM Bank could provide competitive financing for export-oriented activities. The increased budgetary outlay on capital expenditure could also provide sufficient opportunities for credit demand and help the overall growth of the financial sector. On the recapitalisation of various public sector institutions, the announcements were largely in line with our expectations and no capital infusion was announced for public banks as well as the All India Financial Institutions. However, given the weak solvency profile of PSU general insurance companies, we expected some announcements related to their recapitalisation. We will wait for subsequent announcements in the year as the capital infusion into these insurers was outside the budgetary announcements during FY2022 also. Among the populist moves and demand for lower tax rates for individuals, the budgetary announcements significantly improve the attractiveness of the “new tax regime”, which allows individuals to pay taxes at lower rates but with no deductions from taxable income. Increased adoption of this tax regime could potentially impact the demand for investment products such as insurance, which offer deductions. Moreover, the proposal to limit the tax exemption on receipts from insurance policies, which are below Rs 5 lakh premium could also adversely impact the demand for guaranteed income insurance products and hence, the premium growth for insurance companies. Among the other populist announcements, the government also announced the hike in investable limits across various small saving instruments for senior citizens. This could lead to a further increase in competition among banks for deposits at a time when credit growth has been running ahead of deposit growth and is likely to remain so for next year. The market-linked debentures (MLDs) have gained prominence among high-networth individuals during the last few years with annual issuances estimated to be over Rs 250 billion. As the returns on these MLDs were market-linked, the taxation on the long-term capital gains was similar to equity instruments at lower rates. However, incrementally, many of the recent MLDs issuances had been structured to generate debt-like returns and hence became an attractive investment proposition on a post-tax basis. The budget has proposed to tax the income from these MLDs as short-term capital gains, which will attract taxes at applicable tax rates for the investors. As tax-efficiency was the biggest driver for the growth in issuances of these MLDs, the proposed amendments to taxation will adversely impact these issuances.",

Bones also store nutrients and minerals, and they are places where blood cells are made. Humans have more than 200 bones in their bodies-all of different shapes and sizes. Like other parts of our body bones keep changing all the time. They are alive and grow, especially when you are young. The outer surface of a bone is called the periosteum. It is a very thin membrane that has nerves and blood vessels in it. They carry nutrients to the bones. The compact bone is the smooth and very hard part of the bone. It is the part you see when you look at a skeleton. Spongy bone is lighter than compact bone but it is still very strong. It looks like a sponge or honeycomb with a lot of spaces in between. The inside parts of a bone are hollow. They are filled with a jelly called bone marrow. In adults the long bones of the legs and arms are filled with yellow marrow. The ends have red marrow. It is the place where billions of new blood cells are produced every day. When a child is born it has about 300 'soft' bones. As it grows up some of these bones grow together to form the 206 bones that a normal grown-up has. During childhood bones grow with the help of calcium. By the time you are about 20, bones stop growing. The spine is a special part of our skeleton. It has 26 small bones that look like rings and are linked together. These rings are called vertebrae.

The spine protects the spinal cords which are the nerves that send information to the rest of your body. Between each ring there are small soft discs. They keep the vertebrae from rubbing against each other and act as a pillow, so when you jump into the air and come to the ground again it doesn't hurt. Ribs are a cage of bones that protect the most important organs: your heart, lungs, liver and others. You can feel your ribs by touching your chest. Most people have twelve pairs of ribs that look the same on the right and left side. They are attached to the spine in the back. In the centre of your chest there is a strong bone called the sternum. It keeps your ribs in place, so that they don't fall apart. The bones in your head make up your skull. They protect your brain. Some bones in your skull are fixed, so that you can't move them. Others, like your jawbone can be moved. It opens and closes your mouth when you eat, talk or chew food. Babies are born with spaces between the bones in their skull. As a baby grows the spaces disappear and the bones grow together. Your arms and hands make up a total of about 54 bones. They let you write, pick up things or throw a ball. Each arm is attached to a shoulder blade. There are two long bones in your arm which are connected through your elbow. These bones are wider at the ends and thinner in the middle. The wrist connects the lower part of your arm with your hand. It is very flexible so you can twist it and turn it around in many directions. The hand is made up of small separate bones. Each finger has three bones, only your thumb has two. A leg is made up of three bones. They are very large and strong and help support the weight of your body. They are connected to a group of bones called the pelvis, which supports the upper part of your body. The longest bone of our body is the femur. It runs from the pelvis to the knee. The knee itself is protected by the kneecap. The ankle connects the lower part of your leg with your foot. The bones in your feet help you stand and balance your body. A joint is a place that holds two bones together. Fixed joints don't move at all. Some of them are in your skull and in other parts of your body. Moving joints allow you to twist, bend and move different parts of your body. Some of them let you move in only one direction, others allow you to move freely in many directions. Joints have fluids in them, so they can work more easily and don't hurt. Bones are x-rayed. Like all parts of the body our bones can also suffer from certain diseases. Bones need calcium to make them hard. If your body does not get enough vitamin D bones don't have enough calcium, they become soft and curved. People suffer from osteoporosis when they have weak bones. Bones can also break. In babies and young children broken bones grow together quickly, but when people get older it takes longer for bones to be repaired. In elderly people bones heal very slowly-sometimes not at all. Joints also attract diseases when a person gets older. Arthritis is an inflammation of the joint that hurts and sometimes makes it impossible for you to move."
