        "We learned to see, at long last. Partway through the millennium, we figured out how to shape and polish glass so as to see far and to see small, and we dug into dead languages of previous millenniums to name our new aids to seeing-telescope, microscope, spectroscope, spectrophotometer, spectroheliograph and, eventually, television. We figured out the art, the geometry and the semantics of perspective. No wonder our superheroes had X-ray vision; so did we. And infrared vision, and ultraviolet vision, and gamma-ray vision and nuclear-magnetic-resonant vision. We extended our sight far beyond the tiny spectrum our unaided eyes could handle, from violet to red. We looked out, and we looked inside. We saw where earth is and what humans are (if not quite who we are). We noticed quasars and we noticed viruses. Surprise! ‘In all falling rain, carried from gutters into water-butts, animalcules are to be found. in all kinds of water, standing in the open air, animalcules can turn up,’ noted Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the first man to observe bacteria. We figured out some things about colour and space. ‘To Me,’ Isaac Newton remarked modestly, ‘I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.’ Then-and perhaps most important of all-we learned to see faster. Our sight expanded into the fourth dimension. It started innocently enough, with mundane items like railroad scheduling charts and weather histograms: new graphical representations of time. ‘Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record,’ said a famous fictional character, the Time Traveller of H. G. Wells, explaining the fourth dimension years before mathematicians and physicists had worked out the details. ‘This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized?’ The hero of ‘The Time Machine’ was a time traveller who used ivory levers and quartz rods. But Wells also invented another kind of time traveller, a Professor Gibberne, hero of a little-known story published at the turn of the century under the title ‘The New Accelerator.’ Professor Gibberne is a time traveller on drugs-really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life.’",

        "Of the many things that the 2020 Delhi assembly election heralded, one that stands out because of its optics is the public emergence of Hanuman bhakt Arvind Kejriwal. In his victory speech on Tuesday, Arvind Kejriwal thanked Lord Hanuman for blessing Delhi and said the mandate given to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has marked the dawn of a ‘new form of politics’ in India. In Kejriwal's words, this newness is outlined by ‘kaam ki rajneeti (politics of work)’ wherein people would vote on the basis of developmental works (schools, hospitals, affordable healthcare, electricity etc.) carried out by a government. ‘This is an auspicious message for the country,’ he said. No doubt, that's refreshing to hear, especially in a political atmosphere vitiated by a high-decibel cacophony of the worst order. But development was not the only axis on which Arvind Kejriwal's Delhi election campaign rotated on. To mellow down the vitriol of BJP's hard Hindutva politics married to its brand of nationalism, Arvind Kejriwal rebranded himself as a devout Hanuman bhakt who isn't shy of wearing his religious identity down his sleeves; say 'Jai Hind' and 'Vande Matram'; carefully side-step thorny uncomfortable issues like CAA, NRC and Shaheen Bagh; and yet anchor his discourse around development. This careful positioning of himself as a devout Hanuman bhakt in the campaign's last leg ensured Kejriwal that those who were with him on the issue of development and governance, didn't stray away to the BJP on count of polarisation fanned by appeals to religious and nationalistic identities. Having reaped the benefits of this posturing in form of a consecutive sweep (wining 62 of 70 seats), Arvind Kejriwal ensured that his victory speech on Tuesday too echoed the posturing. After thanking the people of Delhi for the landslide mandate ‘for his developmental works’, Kejriwal touched base with his religious identity, lest there remain any doubts. ‘Aaj mangal vaar hai (cheers from the crowd) Hanuman ji ka din hai. Hanuman ji ne aaj apni Dilli pe kripa barsayi hai. Hanuman ji ka bhi bahut bahut dhanyavaad (It's Tuesday today, the day of Lord Hanuman. The Lord has blessed our Delhi and I thank him for this victory),’ he said. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal: This is the day of Lord Hanuman who has blessed the people of Delhi. We pray that Hanuman Ji keeps showing the right path to us so that we continue to serve people for the next five years.",
        "Topic3": "Later in the day Kejriwal visited the Hanuman temple in Delhi's Connaught Place, with his entry marked with loud cries of ‘Jai shree Ram, Jai shree Ram’ from his supporters. Later he told reporters: ‘Hanuman ji sabka bhala karenga (Lord Hanuman will bless us all).’ Not just Arvind Kejriwal, but other AAP leaders-Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chaddha-who addressed AAP workers at the party headquarters on Tuesday, too resonated these identities, leading crowds to the cheers of 'Bharat Mata ki jai', and 'Vande Matram'. Aaj mangal vaar hai...Hanuman ji ka din hai. Hanuman ji ne aaj apni Dilli pe kripa barsayi hai. Hanuman ji ka bhi bahut bahut dhanyavaad. Of course, Arvind Kejriwal and AAP leaders are well within their constitutional right to do so. And that's exactly what would make the Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh (RSS) smile. For long, the RSS has been trying to cultivate a culture where politicians (irrespective of parties) don't feel shy wearing their Hindu identities in public and also cheer along the lines of 'Bharat Mata ki jai' and 'Vande Mataram'. The recent comment of RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi puts this into perspective. ‘Hindu community does not mean Bharatiya Janata Party, and opposing BJP does not amount to opposing Hindus. Political fight will continue but it should not be linked to Hindus,’ Joshi said in Goa. Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary in Goa: Hindu community does not mean Bharatiya Janata Party, and opposing BJP does not amount to opposing Hindus. Political fight will continue but it should not be link so when a Rahul Gandhi takes a ‘holy’ trip to Kailash Mansarovar just before Lok Sabha elections, claiming to be a ‘devout Shiv bhakt’ who is a janeyudhari Brahmin hoping from one temple to the other, the RSS senses a victory of sorts. When a Shashi Tharoor talks proudly about Hinduism and slams RSS and BJP in his book 'Why I am a Hindu' for its polarising politics, the RSS, despite the attacks, senses a victory.", 
        "Topic4": "Two thousand years ago, the great philosopher Aristotle said, ‘Injustice arises when equals are treated unequally and also when unequals are treated equally’. This profound statement is what lies at the heart of equality-a fundamental human right. Every human simply by virtue of being a human being is entitled to equal treatment. The most significant, pervasive and violent discrimination in our country is the centuries old caste system. It was abolished by the Constitution in 1952 and untouchability was declared a crime. They were thus given reservation by the government. Reservation in India is the process of setting aside a certain percentage of seats (vacancies) in government institutions for members of backward and under-represented communities (defined primarily by caste and tribe). It is a form of quota-based affirmative action. Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes are the primary beneficiaries of the reservation policies under the Constitution with the objective of ensuring a 'level' playing field. The Constitution of India states in Article 15(4) that, ‘All citizens shall have equal opportunities of receiving education. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the state from providing special facilities for educationally backward sections’. It also states that, ‘The state shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of society and shall protect them from 'social injustice' and all forms of exploitation’. The Article further states that nothing in Article 15(4) will prevent the nation from helping SCs and STs for their betterment. In 1982, the Constitution specified 15% and 7.5% of vacancies in public sector and government-aided educational institutes as a quota reserved for the SC and ST candidates respectively for a period of five years, after which it was to be reviewed This period was routinely extended by the succeeding governments. The Supreme Court of India ruled that reservations cannot exceed 50% and put a cap on reservations. However, there are state laws that exceed this 50% limit and these are under litigation in the Supreme Court. For example, caste based reservation stands at 69% and the same is applicable to about 87% of the population in the state of Tamil Nadu. 'In 1990, Prime Minister VP Singh announced that 27% of government positions would be set aside for OBCs in addition to the 22.5% already set aside for SCs and STs. This was followed according to the Mandal Commission which was established in India in 1978 by the Janata Party government under Prime Minister Morarji Desai with a mandate to ‘identify the socially or educationally backward’. Now, the question arises whether there is a need to review the reservation policy in India or should continue with the tradition? The basic idea of reservation was undoubtedly superb as it was in all good intent, meant to improve till now the status of those sections of the society which had hitherto been left uncared for. However, as we see it today, the policy of reservation has completely changed in the past few years. There has been unlimited extension of the policy for no one knows how long, it appears as though the policy has come to stay forever and its extension is also as though unlimited, with several more sections joining the band wagon of the classes under reservation. If we look at the reservation policy in India, we are the only country in the world that provides affirmative action based on individual caste identities. It is a well-established fact that reservations are tools of upliftment for those disadvantaged groups who have suffered years of discrimination and oppression at the hands of the higher castes. We the people of India, believe in the concept of 'Vasudeva Kutumbakam' where we take each and every person on equal terms and also take the path of fraternity into its ambit. The reservation policy in India gave a chance to the backward and downtrodden people to be on equal terms with the other classes of the society. It not only helped them in improving their lives and status in the society but also provided them with an opportunity to represent themselves in various aspects of the decision-making part of society, something which was denied to them for a long time. Reservations have come up in educational institutions, in jobs, in state assemblies, in Parliament and in every feasible sphere. It will be a wonder if this system is really going to help us to raise our standards in every sphere or will this become just a tool in the hands of a few, to forward their own interests, as has been up to this juncture. The reservation policy has taken only few families of weaker sections and not the masses",

All United Nations Security Council or UNSC is one of the six organs of the United Nations, established under the UN charter. The primary objective of the UNSC is to maintain international peace and security. It looks into matters related to disputes and settlements among the countries. The UNSC has fifteen members in all of which there are five permanent and ten non-permanent members. The United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and France are the five permanent members. Of the ten non-permanent these years the number of the UN member countries has quadrupled from 51 to 193. Post-Cold War, the member countries have been pursuing the expansion of Security LIN Council. India is one of the founding members of the United Nations but at that time it was under British rule and economically backward. With its improving economic conditions, rising GDP, India has been eying the permanent membership of the Security Council for long. A permanent member is expected to provide its support to the UNSC in all aspects in order to maintain international law and order. Though this doesn't mean the member has to possess nuclear weapons, it must have a strong military trained at par with the international standards. The reform5 in the membership of the UNSC have to be backed by the LIN General Assembly In a bid to pursue its membership, India formed an alliance with Brazil, Japan: and Germany to give momentum to its campaign for a permanent seat in the countries decided to get a push through a United Nations General Assembly (LINGA) resolution in 2005 which initially gained momentum but backfired later on. This move was doomed as a result of many factors. Due to a lack of consensus among the African countries regarding its representative for UNSC, there wasn't a single representation from the African continent. The f strained relations between China and Japan is another factor for the backfiring of the resolution. The Indian government has been actively taking forward this matter at the United Nations General",
        "Topic6": "The term euthanasia comes from the Greek word 'euthanatos meaning 'good death. It is an act or practice of ending the lite of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition. It is also known as mercy killing' which is an act where the individual who has no chance of survival as he is suffering from painful life, ends his life in a painless manner. lt is a gentle, easy and painless death. It is basically to bring about the death of a terminally ill patient or a disabled. Euthanasia is thus practised so that a person can live as well as die with dignity. There are two types of euthanasia namely, active euthanasia and passive euthanasia. Active euthanasia or positive euthanasia reters to causing intentional death of a human being by direct intervention. It is a direct action performed to end useless life and a meaningless existence. E.g. by giving lethal dose of a drug or by giving a lethal injection. On the other hand, passive euthanasia or negative euthanasia is intentionally causing death by not providing essential, necessary and ordinary care or food and water. It implies to discontinuing, withdrawing or removing artificial life support system. Passive euthanasia is usually slower and more uncomfortable than active. 5etore moving further, it is important to note that there is a difference between Suicide and 'Euthanasia'. In a suicide, a man voluntarily kills himself by stabbing poisoning or by any other mean. it is an act of intentionally killing oneself due to depression or other reasons. On the other hand, euthanasia is an action of a person to bring to an end the lite or another person.

        "Topic7": "How much policy of reservation is successful in our country? The main object of reservation is to uplift the poor and the down-trodden. But in reality, the experience of the past more than half a century shows that the policy of reservation has miserably failed to achieve its objectives. It is far from promoting harmony and spirit of brotherhood among the people, which is the goal of our Constitution. It is appreciable that financial help and other assistance are being given to the needy through the policy of reservation. But reality is that the policy of improving their conditions has made them dependent on crutches which mar their self-confidence. On the other hand, policy of reservation perpetuates injustice and disservice to the nation, because merit is thrown to the winds and its place is taken by inefficiency. In the light of the experience of reservation during the long span of more than half a century, it is quite evident that if the present policy of reservation is continued, the conditions of Scheduled castes and Scheduled Tribes will not improve much and up to the desired target, because it is absolutely not a right solution to improve their living standard. Moreover, reservation is creating injustice to deserved persons who work hard from their childhood and when time comes for selection showing personal worth and capability, it is ignored and in place, inefficient persons are selected under reservation. Here inefficiency under the garb of reservation takes the place of capable, deserving and efficient persons. All over the world, the stress is on talent, on merit and excellence. Our country is passing through a phase of development and we must not afford to sacrifice efficiency by giving preference to only those who belong to particular categories of backwardness ignoring meritorious and competent persons. The right solution to help and uplift the backward category is to make them competent through special primary schools at per with convent schools so that they can complete with other better students in higher classes and do not feel complex that they are given special favour through the policy of reservation.",
        "Topic8": "When a Shashi Tharoor talks proudly about Hinduism and slams RSS and BJP in his book 'Why I am a Hindu' for its polarising politics, the RSS, despite the attacks, senses a victory. For the RSS, the first stepping stone rests in creating an atmosphere where: (a) politicians aren't ashamed of wearing their Hindu identities in public life; (b) aren't shy of responding to the cheers of 'Bharat Mata ki jai' and 'Vande Mataram'. Arvind Kejriwal with his deputy Manish Sisodia and wife Sunita, offers prayers at the Hanuman Mandir at Connaught Place after his party's thumping win the Delhi assembly election on Tuesday. Once this stage is achieved, the next logical step would be to increase the decibel of these cheers. In this context, one should not be surprised that with the upcoming elections in Bihar and West Bengal, we may see another set of non-BJP leaders following the tracks of Arvind Kejriwal: Mamata Banerjee invoking Maa Durga and the Lalu Yadav's RJD reaping some electoral dividends from Tej Pratap's different avatars of Shiva, Krishna among others. Thus, while Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor and others may try to rebrand themselves to counter BJP's Hindutva with their ideas of Hindusim, in one form or the other they end up playing on the grounds set by the RSS-one where the broad boundaries are set but individuals are free to customise as per local circumstances. The RSS has no reason not to be happy with this setting. At least for the moment, because a gain is gain, no matter where and how it comes from. Now that these leaders have consciously rebranded themselves as Hanuman and Shiv bhakts (and many will embrace others deities later on) the challenge for them is to see how distant can they travel without inching closer to stage two of the RSS agenda i.e. to make the cries louder and perfume it with one-upmanship.",
        "Topic9": "Medicine is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ‘variable and inconsistent’ for any condition, but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner. In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery. Medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia; the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy.",
        "Topic10": "In modern clinical practice, physicians personally assess patients in order to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g. stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g. blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions. Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue. The components of the medical interview and encounter are: Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the 'symptoms.' They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one also called 'chief concern' or 'presenting complaint'. History of present illness (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). Medical history comprises HPI and PMH. Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does. Medications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as well as alternative and herbal medicines/herbal remedies. Allergies are also recorded. Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past infectious diseases or vaccinations, history of known allergies. Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history,",

It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above. The treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. Follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system, various forms of ‘utilization review’, such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services. The medical decision-making (MDM) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem. On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations. Institutions Colour fresco of an ancient hospital setting The Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, fresco by Domenico di Bartolo, 1441â€’1442 Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.",
        "Topic12": "From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world. Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three. Most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly. Collection of glass bottles of different sizes Modern drug ampoules Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness, new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other. Primary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients.",
        "Topic13": "Surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncologic surgery, orthopaedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery, transplant surgery, trauma surgery, urology, vascular surgery, and paediatric surgery. In some centres, anaesthesiology is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se. Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming. Internal specialty Internal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied. In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called ‘internists.’ Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth nations, such specialists are often called physicians. These terms, internist or physician (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynaecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialties. Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized;",

        "Topic18": "A soldier by temperament, Maharaja Ranjit Singh was also a lover of the arts. Apart from his numerous adventures, big and small, he was always kept mentally preoccupied. The only relaxation he indulged in was a long ride on one of his favourite horses or to witness dance & music. And yet his admirers make a fairly convincing case that the Maharaja loved the arts and endeavoured to promote artistic activity in his regime. What appears to be more significant? Is Maharaja Ranjit Singh's unmistakably secular approach in matters pertaining to the arts, whether it was painting or architecture, music or dance. When Maharaja annexed Kangra and other hill states, the people of Punjab generally and Lahore darbar in particular came in touch with the glorious heritage of Pahari artists, who were patronised without any consideration of caste and creed by the Maharaja, his household and even his courtiers. A number of them are said to have entered into the service of the Maharaja or his nobles. According to Mr. B.N. Goswamy, an eminent art critic, some of the artists may be named as Nikka, Gokal, Harkhu, Chhajju and Damodar, all of Rajol family of artists that we know so well. Maharaja Ranjit Singh's regime is better known for its pro-motion of the arts of portraiture. Commissioning eminent artists to make portraits seems to have been in fashion. The portraits made by the native or foreign artists were both bold and penetrating. It is also said that there was a time when the Maharaja would not encourage any artist, howsoever eminent, even to make a fleeting sketch of him. He had a good reason for it with one eye missing. Be had hardly anything to recommend him for portrayal. But, before long, the Maharaja shook off his allergy, when he found artists bringing out his intellectual sharpness, the majesty of his person and the nobility of his character in his portraits. To start with, the artists painted the Maharaja from the right side to avoid his blind eye. Some of the better known paintings of the period are Emily Eden's water lour sketch of the Shalimar Garden, the credit for which should go to the aesthetic taste of the Maharaja. ‘The Court of Lahore’ is another masterpiece done in oil colour.",
        "Topic19": "A government employee at the time of retirement can draw a certain amount in lump sum under the existing system of pension and have his monthly pension reduced proportionately. One cut pension is calculated according to the prescribed scale on the production of the medical certificate regarding life expectancy. The rule requires that the cut should continue until the death of the pensioner whatever the commuted amount. In many cases, pensioners have paid back as ‘outs’ in their pensions twice or thrice the commuted amount. Pensioners call this rule exploitive and demand its repeal Under the scheme of opting for death-cum-retirement gratuity intro- deed in 1950, the rate of pension is reduced from one half of the employee's average emoluments to three-eighths against the payment of an amount equal to 15 months' pay. In this case too, the reduction in pension continues even after the amount taken as gratuity has been fully repaid. A family pension scheme was introduced on January 1, 1964 but the widows of pensioners who retire before that date have been deprived of it. The Government has, however, given some con- cession to the pensioners in recent years. The rate of pension, the amount of gratuity and the limit of death-cum-retirement gratuity have been raised. The pension is calculated on the average of last 10 months' emoluments instead of 36 months and cash payment is made in lieu of 180 days' leave due at the time of retirement. An Indian pensioner is perhaps the least paid in the world. Holland, Iran, Belgium, Yugoslavia and Turkey (where the retiring age is 65), the retired men are paid as pension the full salary they drew last. In U.S.A., Italy, Spain, West Germany, France, East Germany, U.K., U.S.S.R., the Netherlands and Sweden, the pensioners get between 60 and 80 present of the salaries they drew last. Whereas in India, the pension has been increased by ridiculously small amounts in the last 30 years. In U.K., it has kept pace with the prices. A British 1.C.S. officer, whose original pension like Indian officers of the same service was 1000 pounds a year, now draws 7000 pounds a year.",
        "Topic20": "Media plays a vital role in a democratic country like India where public opinion has a major aspect. Media is considered to be the fourth pillar of the society, the other three being, legislative, executive and the judiciary system. It is even said to be a 'mirror' and 'modular' of public opinion. In other words, we may say that the public replicates or follows as well as accumulates opinions and decisions through the media and the information displayed by it. People not only obtain real information about public matters From the news media, but also pick up how much prominence to assign to a subject on the basis of the highlighting and priority given to it in the news. Internet including e-mails and blogs, television, radio and newspapers play a significant role in the formation of outlooks and opinions of the general public News media highlights the personalities (politicians, people involved in film industry and other celebrities) and issues and common man believes and forms opinion about them according to the news. Today's picture of media is entirely different. Public can talk about the incidents happening not only in the country but also outside the geographical boundaries only due to awareness created by media. Media also plays a crucial role in enlightening and educating the people. It can aid public involvement through advocating issues and transferring knowledge skills and technologies to the people. Awareness about various rural development programmes, propagation of family planning could be spread easily by using the media. Media awaken people against many evils prevailed in the society. Apart from this, it covers many students in a single platform through its educational programmes. The impact of media can be seen on the youth also. Youth's exposure to media has increased evidently in past few years. The usage of personalised forms of media, comprising text messages and social networking sites has exponentially expanded. It is also contributing to greater awareness of political issues and prospects for public activities.",

You know what I mean. And the trees all died. They were orange trees. I don't know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn't the best. We complained about it. So we've got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we've got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing. It wouldn't have been so bad except that just a couple of weeks before the thing with the trees, the snakes all died. But I think that the snakes â€’ well, the reason that the snakes kicked off was that... you remember, the boiler was shut off for four days because of the strike, and that was explicable. It was something you could explain to the kids because of the strike. I mean, none of their parents would let them cross the picket line and they knew there was a strike going on and what it meant. So when things got started up again and we found the snakes they weren't too disturbed. With the herb gardens it was probably a case of overwatering, and at least now they know not to overwater. The children were very conscientious with the herb gardens and some of them probably... you know, slipped them a little extra water when we weren't looking. Or maybe... well, I don't like to think about sabotage, although it did occur to us. I mean, it was something that crossed our minds. We were thinking that way probably because before that the gerbils had died, and the white mice had died, and the salamander... well, now they know not to carry them around in plastic bags. Of course we expected the tropical fish to die that was no surprise. Those numbers, you look at them crooked and they're belly-up on the surface. But the lesson plan called for a tropical fish input at that point, there was nothing we could do, it happens every year, you just have to hurry past it. We weren't even supposed to have a puppy.

So we had this puppy. As soon as I saw the puppy I thought, Oh Christ, I bet it will live for about two weeks and then... And that's what it did. It wasn't supposed to be in the classroom at all, there's some kind of regulation about it, but you can't tell them they can't have a puppy when the puppy is already there, right in front of them, running around on the floor and yap yap yapping. They named it Edgar that is, they named it after me. They had a lot of fun running after it and yelling, ‘Here, Edgar! Nice Edgar!’ Then they'd laugh like hell. They enjoyed the ambiguity. I enjoyed it myself. I don't mind being kidded. They made a little house for it in the supply closet and all that. I don't know what it died of. Distemper, I guess. It probably hadn't had any shots.

        "Topic22": "An honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family by other members as it is believed that the victim has brought shame or dishonour upon the family or the community she belongs. Honour killing usually is committed by male family members against female family members, who are held to have brought dishonour upon the family. Rarely men can also be the victims of honour killing. The term 'honour killing' applies to both men and women in cultures that practice it. The distinctive nature of honour killing is the collective nature of the crime. Many members of an extended family or community plan the act together and the commit the crime. Another significant characteristic of honour killing is that the perpetrators often do not face negative stigma with in their family and community, because their behaviour is seen as justified Honour killing is the murder of a member of a family or by other members due to the perpetrator's belief that the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or has violated the principle of a community or religion. Honour killing are directed mostly against women and girls. According to statistics, honour killings have been reported in Northern regions of India mainly in the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It is prevalent to a lesser extent in South India and the Western Indian states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. In West Bengal, honour killings completely ceased about a century age, due to reformism.

Richard Russell, who liked to be called Beebo, was a 29-year-old man living in Sumner, Washington, who was born in Key West, Florida, and moved to Wasilla, Alaska, when he was 7 years old, according to a Web page he set up for a college communications class. He has not been officially named by authorities, but his family and multiple news media outlets have reported his identity. Russell worked for Horizon Airlines, a sister carrier of Alaska Airlines, as a ground service agent who helped baggage handlers and was part of Horizon's tow team, which moved planes around on the tarmac. It was a job that gave him the perk of ‘being able to fly to Alaska at my leisure,’ he wrote on the page. In his final moments captured by partial recordings of his conversations with air traffic controllers that were published online by Broadcastify.com, Russell spoke calmly and said he was sorry to disappoint people who cared about him and described himself as a ‘broken guy’. ‘Got a few screws loose, I guess,’ he is heard saying in the recording. ‘Never really knew it until now.’ Authorities say he commandeered an empty Bombardier Q400, 107-foot long turboprop aircraft on Friday night from a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He flew for about an hour, often erratically with attempts at aerial stunts, before crashing on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, about 40 km to the southwest.

        "Topic24": "Massively stepped-up security in China's restive far western region of Xinjiang has helped prevent ‘great tragedy’, a state-run newspaper said on Monday, in the country's first response to a critical United Nations report on the situation there. A UN human rights panel said on Friday that it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a ‘massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy’. China has said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority. Hundreds have died in unrest there in recent years. In joint editorials in its Chinese and English versions, the widely-read Global Times tabloid said criticism of the rights record in Xinjiang was aimed at stirring trouble there and destroying hard-earned stability. China's security presence there has prevented Xinjiang from becoming another Syria or Libya, it added. ‘There is no doubt that the current peace and stability in Xinjiang is partly due to the high intensity of regulations. Police and security posts can be seen everywhere in Xinjiang,’ the paper wrote. ‘But it's a phase that Xinjiang has to go through in rebuilding peace and prosperity and it will transition to normal governance.’ Maintaining peace and stability there is in the basic interest of people in Xinjiang and all of China, it added. ‘The turnaround in Xinjiang's security situation has avoided a great tragedy and saved countless lives, thanks to powerful Chinese law and the strong ruling power of the Communist Party of China,’ the paper wrote. ‘What the West has been hyping has destroyed numerous countries and regions. When the same evil influence was spreading in Xinjiang, it was decisively curbed.’ Xinjiang has ‘no room for destructive Western public opinions’, and all steps must be taken to ensure it.",

The ‘Unite the Right 2’ march-held to commemorate the anniversary of a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that claimed three lives-will be countered by marchers that have come together from a range of organisations such as Black Lives Matter and DC United Against Hate. While both protesters and counter-protesters are headed to Lafayette Park, just outside the White House, they have permits for different routes and gathering points. Authorities plan to keep them apart to avoid confrontations that tend to turn heated and violent-last year, one woman was killed and several others were injured in numerous skirmishes that broke out. The Trumps are not in Washington-the president is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf resort-but both appeared keen to get a handle on the situation before it turned ugly. ‘One year ago in Charlottesville, we witnessed an ugly display of hatred, racism, bigotry & violence,’ Ivanka Trump tweeted on Saturday, adding: ‘While Americans are blessed to live in a nation that protects liberty, freedom of speech and diversity of opinion, there is no place for white supremacy, racism and neo-nazism in our great country. ‘Rather than tearing each other down with hatred, racism & violence, we can lift one another up, strengthen our communities and strive to help every American achieve his or her full potential!’ Her father had called for peace in a tweet earlier in the day. ‘The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division.

        "Topic26": "NASA on Sunday launched its ambitious Parker Solar Probe a day later than it was scheduled to after multiple checks exhausted the launch window. Liftoff took place from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Tampa, Florida. The Parker probe is expected to come within 6.16 million kms (3.83 mn miles) of the sun, the closest a spacecraft has ever gotten to the star. The mission will last 6 years and 11 months, and in that time the Parker probe will orbit the sun 24 times. With each orbit it will push closer and closer to the sun, ultimately circling the star at a distance that is less than 10 radii of the sun. No wonder scientists consider it the coolest, hottest mission under the sun, and what better day to launch to the sun than Sunday as NASA noted. The launch was called off at the last minute on Saturday after a gaseous helium pressure red alarm emerged that the scientists did not have enough time to troubleshoot. ‘The launch of a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket carrying the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft was scrubbed today due to a violation of a launch limit, resulting in a hold,’ NASA, said in a statement. ‘There was not enough time remaining in the window to recycle.’ The mission, that costs about $1.5 bn has been over five decades in the making, and is unique for bringing a space probe closer to the sun than any manmade object. One of the reasons, scientists are sending the probe is the Sun's atmosphere and the weird property it exhibits, of being hotter than the surface of the sun itself. It is a puzzle because the further one moves from the source of heat the temperatures should fall. The other great mystery is the behaviour of 'solar wind,' a stream of charged particles emitted by the sun too.",
        "Topic27": "China's top newspaper rebutted growing criticism in government circles that Beijing should have taken a lower profile to head off its trade war with the United States, saying on Friday that, like an elephant, China cannot hide its size and strength. The growing trade conflict is causing rifts within China's Communist Party, with some critics saying that an overly nationalistic Chinese stance may have hardened the US position, sources close to the government have said. The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily took direct aim at those it said were naysayers in an unusually public rebuttal to a debate that has been happening largely behind closed doors in policy-making circles in China. While condemnation of the White House has come at home and abroad, there are those who have spread ‘specious’ views on the internet, it said in a lengthy commentary. ‘One of these puts the blame on China, saying that 'China's strategy is too confident and high profile, incurring a one-two punches from the United States',’ it said. ‘Another of these criticises China saying that it shouldn't strike back,’ the paper said. ‘The meaning is-as long as China caves in, the United States will raise its hand high in mercy, and the Sino-US trade war won't happen.’ However, it was absolutely not the case that China brought this upon itself, the commentary said. History showed that the United States had always gone after countries, such as the former Soviet Union, Britain or Japan, that were perceived as threatening its global dominance. That had brought China into the firing line with its enormous and growing economy, the People's Daily said. ‘After more than a century of hard work, China has returned to the centre of the world stage, and this is the basic fact we must observe in the China-US trade friction,’ the paper wrote. ‘Such a large size, such a heavy thing, can't be hidden by 'being low key’.",

Admitting that he had an alcoholic cocktail at a pub before heading home, 39-year-old Jeyendran Jeyapal said it was his first offence and pleaded for minimum punishment in the court. Jeyapal, a deputy senior state counsel in Singapore's Attorney-General's Chambers, also said he had been cooperative with police officers when stopped, the Channel News Asia reported. The lawyer was stopped by a traffic police officer at a road block along Second Hospital Avenue at around 4:50 am on February 11 this year. The officer noticed that Jeyapal had ‘alcoholic breath’ following which a breathalyser test was done in which he failed. Jeyapal was then taken to the Traffic Police Division where it was revealed that he had 48 mg of alcohol in every 100 ml of breath, which exceeded the limit of 35mg, deputy public prosecutor Bhajanvir Singh told the court and said he leave the sentencing up to the judge. In his defence, Jeyendran said he was celebrating a friend's birthday and took the alcohol offered by him so as not to disappoint him. The District Judge, Victor Yeo, said he ‘was not entirely persuaded’ by the argument. ‘In my view, he could have declined the drink,’ the judge said. However, noting that Jeyapal was not doing any other traffic offence like speeding or driving dangerously, the judge imposed a fine of SGD 1,600 on him and put a ban on his driving for one year. Under Singaporean law, drink driving for the first time could attract a jail term for up to six months or a fine between SGD 1,000 and SGD 5,000.",

Before we sit down and thrash out a Gold movie review, it is important to list everything that Akshay Kumar's Independence Day offering is not in these divisive times, when using the P-word can get you immediate claps and whistles, Gold shows them as our allies and encourages a healthy relationship. Its Independence Day rhetoric can be schmaltzy but is never cloying, asking us, as citizens, to dream and achieve them, over decades and generations, because only that can make a country great. Gold begins at 1936 Olympics in Berlin where Akshay Kumar is the general 'hey you' of the British India's national hockey team. Somewhere between .not saluting Mein Fuhrer and carrying the Indian Flag next to his heart, he establishes his patriotism. A thrilling hockey match follows and the action is equally engrossing on the bleachers (watch out for the Hitler lookalike). Whether Indians win or lose is immaterial, for standing on the podium would be slaves. There, in a country covered with swastikas, Akshay's Tapan Das vows with a hand on the Tricolour, to win the medal for a free India. The opening and the credits make for the most rousing 20 minutes of Gold. They tug at your heartstrings, appeal to your national pride and establish Tapan as our man in the Reema Kagati film. A song takes us through the most defining moments in world history-World War 2, Olympics getting cancelled, India's Independence Day-as Tapan fills the hockey shaped hole in his heart with alcohol. Tapan's love for his country never wavers and neither does our faith in him. Today's alcoholic is tomorrow's patriot.

        "Topic30": "The fact that its span takes us over one of the most tumultuous time in the history of world and India makes it even more stirring. Well done Akshay Kumar and Reema Kagti for choosing the right subject and delivering a crackling film. And then, extra marks to Akshay for delivering an engrossing performance. While walking into the theatre, I had misgivings about Akshay playing a Bengali but he has managed the act with finesse. He is also secure in his space and lets others shine. Akshay is not the hockey captain, the coach or the manager; he is just a man with a dream. During the most important moments of the film, he is either outvoted or left behind. As the superstar in the film, he leads but gives space to others wherever needed. That perhaps is the biggest achievement of Gold-it fleshes out its characters, giving everybody a space to breathe. Thanks to Akshay sharing the spotlight, an ensemble cast can rise and shine. There's Kunal Kapoor's erstwhile hockey captain and Vineet Singh's Muslim vice-captain and a freedom fighter. However, the team's dynamics and its inner push-and-pull are presented through the competition between Raghubir Pratap Singh (Amit Sadh) and Himmat Singh (Sunny Kaushal). Different in circumstances and demeanours, they give us a major Chak De! Deja vu during Gold. Mouni Roy as Akshay's wife Monobina is just the right mixture of crotchety and charming. With her grasp of Bengali, she brings that extra something to the film's milieu. Akshay and Mouni's scenes together are the spice that Gold needed; she takes down her husband a notch or two every time they are together. Patriotism is also weaved in nicely given it is the Independence Day release and is a sports drama that has a country avenging decades of slavery. You know who is going to win, you know what is going to happen in the middle and you know National Anthem will play before it is over, but it is August 15 and you're prepared. More than manipulation, it is the predictability that can become bit of a drag at certain places. For instance, if there are two centre forwards vying to be the star of the team, you know there will be a male appropriation of the 'Komal, dikha de us launde ko' moment. There are many such scenes in the film that feel obvious but such is the tenor of the film that you bob along. Overall, Gold is a well plotted drama that sometimes devolves into schmaltz and melodrama. However, it gives us solid two-and-half hours of tricolour hued entertainment. We suggest XL sized popcorn tubs.",

Getting up late and rushing to work is not a good way to start the day at all. Ideally you should get up, have a good breakfast, get ready and still have time before you need to leave. But for the ones who are perpetually late risers, waking up late, getting a mini heart attack and then reaching office past their reporting time becomes the norm. Here are a few ways to get up in time so that you have an early start to your day. The first and toughest part about every morning is getting out of bed. Once you do this, you can start off with your day. But that's easier said than done. One way of doing this is placing your alarm clock away from where you are sleeping so you are forced to get up from bed. To be doubly sure, you can have another alarm in another corner of the room so that you will have no option but get out of bed. In order to start waking up early, you need to be in that sort of an environment. You can do this by watching videos or listening to podcasts about getting up early. Understand why it is beneficial for you to wake up early. Another way you can get out of bed is if you have a list of things that you have to do in the morning. Whether it is eating breakfast, reading the newspaper or doing other stuff, you should have a ready list of the things you need to so that you actually look forward to getting up in the morning.

And these rules are never put up on a soft board, but are understood. No one likes that guy who puts down his towel on a machine, only to use it after an hour. So, if you want to earn a few brownie points among your gym pals, we suggest you read further. These unwritten rules around hygiene, cleanliness, common courtesy are often ignored, but it's important to follow them. Always, always put the equipment back from where you picked up. Whether it is weight, foam rollers, yoga mats make sure you keep it back from where you found it. This will not only save time for the person who wants to work out after you, but will also keep the work out area orderly. If you're working out on a machine, make sure to wipe it down once you're done. Nothing is grosser that having to clean someone else's sweat. Don't blast your techno music; the person working out next to you may prefer metal. Always carry your headphones to listen to your favourite music, podcast or watch your bookmarked shows. It's ok if you wish to step away from the machine for a couple of minutes, but don't keep a towel on a machine to reserve it if you're only going to be back after more than 10 minutes. Let someone else use it while you're busy. We agree that lifting heavy weights can involve some amount of shouting, but avoid unnecessary yelling as it may be intimidating to some. And it can also be irritating. The gym is where you come to work out, so avoid making or taking long calls. If you really need to speak, then just step out.",

While domestic tourists find the beaches unsafe during the nights, international tourists find it safe to be on the beaches during the nights,’ the study has said. According to the study, 62.19% of domestic tourists felt unsafe about spending time on Goan beaches at night. ‘Formation of an all-women police force for night patrolling will instil confidence among women tourists and intervene in an emergency situation,’ the study said. The research, Shaikh said, involved interviewing 400 tourists visiting Goa, both domestic and foreign. The issue was first highlighted following the sexual assault and subsequent death of 15-year-old British teenager Scarlett Keeling in 2008 at north Goa's Anjuna beach. ‘The death of 15-year-old Scarlet Keeling has made this place a talking point and a pet bashing subject for the foreign media. The deaths of foreign nationals raise the question whether Goa is still a safe destination for tourists,’ the study said. A recent gangrape of a native young woman by a three tourists from Indore also heightened civic anxieties over the issue of woman's safety on the state's beaches. Last month, the Panaji bench of the Bombay High Court directed the state government to set up a special cell for a focussed probe into the death of 245 foreign tourists over the last 21 years.

After Israel was founded in 1948, millions of Palestinians fled their homelands and settled in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. At that time, Gaza belonged to Egypt. In 1967, Israel occupied the area after the 6-Day War. In the decades that followed, several conflicts have arisen between Palestinians and Israelis. The Gaza Strip is a 25 mile-long area on the Mediterranean coast. Most of its 1.8 million people live in extreme poverty. Infrastructure is weak; food and electricity are often scarce. Over 40% of the Palestinians are unemployed because they cannot find any work in Gaza. Some of them travel across the border to work in Israel. The United Nations manages almost half of the schools in Gaza, but more are needed to deal with the rise in population, which is expected to grow to over 2 million by 2020. The UN also says that more and more houses and apartments are needed for people who have lost their homes during Israeli air strikes. In 2005, Israel decided to withdraw their army from the Gaza Strip in an attempt to allow Palestinians to rule themselves. It also pulled out 5000 Israelis, who settled in the region. Shortly afterwards, a terrorist organization called Hamas took power after winning general elections. Hamas does not recognise Israel as a sovereign state and wants to destroy the Jewish country. Its aim is to give Palestinians their old homeland back. In the last few years, Israel has led an all-out war against Hamas. It controls what gets in and out of Gaza at the border crossings in the east and north. Israel has set up land and sea blockades to protect itself and controls the airspace over Gaza.

By looking at and examining layers of rocks and the fossils they contain they are able to tell us what the earth looked like at a certain time in history and what kind of plants and animals lived at that time. Scientists think that the earth probably was formed at the same time as the rest of our solar system, about 4.6 billion years ago. The solar system may have begun as a cloud of dust, from which the sun and the planets evolved. Small particles crashed into each other to create bigger objects, which then turned into smaller or larger planets. Our earth is made up of three basic layers. The centre has a core made of iron and nickel. Around it is a thick layer of rock called the mantle and around that is a thin layer of rock called the crust. When the earth formed over 4 billion years ago it was totally different from the planet we live on today. There were no plants or animals, only rock, desert, water and ice. The atmosphere probably consisted of carbon dioxide and steam with almost no oxygen to breathe. The oldest period of the earth's history lasted from the beginnings four and a half billion years ago to about 600 million years ago. At first simple forms of one-celled life developed in the oceans. Later on bacteria and algae evolved. Towards the middle of the Precambrian, about 2 billion years ago, more complex organisms, sponge-like creatures and soft-bodied animals lived in the seas. During this time there was no life on land because there was not enough oxygen to breathe. As the Precambrian came to an end the oceans were full of life. Plants started absorbing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turned it into oxygen. Early continents formed, but they looked.",

Some are two-dimensional like circles, squares or triangles; others are three-dimensional like cubes, balls or cones. Geometry shows us how we can construct or draw such forms and how to measure them. We need geometry in everyday life. Houses are made up of geometrical shapes. Pilots use geometry when they plan their routes and surveyors need geometry to make maps and measure areas of land. The world is full of geometric shapes. Egyptian pyramids got their name from geometry and the biggest building in Washington is the Pentagon, a structure that has five sides. Plane Figures and Shapes. A plane is a flat surface like the top of a table. Plane geometry is also called two-dimensional geometry. The simplest objects in geometry are lines and angles. A line is straight and has two arrowheads which show that it continues in both directions. A ray is a line that has a starting point and then goes on in a certain direction. Two lines that come together and have the same starting point form an angle. It can be measured in degrees angles that make square corners measure 90Â° and are called right angles. Angles with less than 90Â° are acute; those with more than 90Â° are called obtuse. Two lines that never meet are parallel. When several segments of a line join together they create a closed figure called a polygon. Rule of Pythagoras - A polygon with three sides is a triangle. If all three sides have the same length we have an equilateral triangle, two sides of the same length make up an isosceles triangle. A triangle with one right angle is called a right triangle. The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse, the other two sides are called legs. The Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who lived.",

They get paid less than men for the same work that they do and in some cases do not have the same opportunities as men to reach high-ranking positions. However this is starting to change. Especially organizations, like the United Nations or UNESCO are giving women better opportunities. Many European Union countries have introduced quotas for women in high-ranking positions. But in other areas they are still second-class citizens. In industrial countries of the developed world they have become more than equal to males. In the past four decades the proportion of women who have paid jobs has gone up from below half to 64 %. There are, however, differences from country to country. While in Scandinavian countries almost three quarters of all women have a job, the number of females on the labour force in southern and Eastern Europe is only about 50%. The role of women has changed drastically during the 20th century. In the early 1900s female workers were employed mainly in factories or worked as servants. In the course of time they got more educated and started working as nurses, teachers, even doctors and lawyers. In the 1960s, women, for the first time, were able to actively plan their families. Birth control pills and other contraceptives made it possible for women to have a career, family or even both. Many went to high school and college and sought a job. In the 1970s women in developed countries started to become a major part of the workforce. More females in the workforce have brought along many advantages for industries and employers.

A year later, on October 3, 1990, East and West Germany were reunited, after being separate states for forty years. 20 years ago German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pushed unification forward and served as the architect of a united Germany. He promised East Germans blooming landscapes and a new western-style life. Not everyone in the western world wanted a united Germany. Great Britain and France were opposed because they thought Germany would become too powerful. On the whole, German reunification has been a success. Much progress has been made in the eastern part of Germany in the last 20 years. City and towns have been modernized. Most East Germans are better off than they were 20 years ago. Eastern Germany has become a home to new industries, especially in the fields of biotechnology and renewable energy. Productivity is about 80% of the West German level, higher than any of the former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. Berlin, a divided city for forty years, has won new importance and become the capital of a reunified Germany. Since 1990 the city has been expanding. The Reichstag building has been newly designed and the open Brandenburg Gate has become the symbol of unity. However, many problems remain. Income is still lower than in the western part of Germany. Workers earn 20% less than their western colleagues. Unemployment in the eastern states is almost double the rate of western Germany. Since 1990 almost 1.5 million ‘Ossis’ as the Eastern Germans are called, mostly higher educated and younger people, have moved from east to west in search of better jobs and more opportunities.

During the next twenty years until his death in 1937 he wrote more than five hundred more songs. He also wrote an opera as well as music for piano and orchestra. Many of George Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These comedies, mixed with plenty of songs, were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. One of Gershwin's musical plays, ‘Girl Crazy’ introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman, who later on became a celebrated performer in America. In the play she sang ‘I Got Rhythm’, a world hit. Many songs that Gershwin wrote for musical plays and films have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way-from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? George Gershwin-American Composer. In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. George Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it. The concert was just a few weeks away, and Gershwin got to work. And, in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called ‘Rhapsody in Blue’. Gershwin himself played the piano at that concert. The audience, made up of some of the greatest classical musicians of the time were electrified when they heard his music. Rhapsody in Blue made George Gershwin famous all over the world. He showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. Gershwin also wrote an opera, ‘Porgy and Bess’.",

About 2000 pandas live in the wilderness, 300 live in various zoos around the world. Recently, there have been campaigns in many countries to save the giant panda. It has been driven away from its natural habitat because of deforestation, intensive farming and the creation of new settlements. The giant panda can reach a height of up to 1.5 metres and weigh up to 150 kg. Pandas have bodies like bears, but scientists do not know why they grow a black and white fur. The thick fur keeps them warm during the cold winter months and the white colour protects them from possible enemies in the snow-covered mountains in which they live. Pandas have large teeth, which they need to eat bamboo, their basic food. The animals can eat up to 15 kg of bamboo a day.

        "Topic44": "A glacier is a mass of thick ice that stays frozen and can move slowly over land. During the Ice Age, which ended about 10,000 years ago, many parts of the world were covered with glaciers. Almost all of Canada and the northern parts of Europe, like Scandinavia and Siberia were covered with ice. Today, the large ice masses of the Ice Age are gone but there are still glaciers all over the world. Most of them exist high up in mountain regions but even around the equator there are places where snow falls and never melts. Glaciers can form in places where the snow that falls in winter months cannot completely melt away during the summer. The layers of snow get thicker and thicker. When it melts and freezes over and over again it turns into ice. This ice can become very heavy and starts to move down valleys. The speed at which glaciers move depends on the climate. When it gets colder glaciers get bigger and move downwards. When it gets warmer over a longer period of time glaciers melt and retreat back to the tops of the mountains. In some cases glaciers can move up to 1 km or even more every year. When a glacier moves over land slowly it picks up rock and dirt and carries these materials along with it. When a glacier comes to a standstill it piles up this material to form moraines. The gigantic weight and power of glaciers can even reshape mountains. This happened to the Alps and other mountain ranges during the Ice Age. The earth's glaciers hold about 75% of the worlds freshwater. Many people think that if temperatures around the world increase, more and more ice will melt. Sea levels will go up and flood many coastal areas. Valley glaciers grow high up in the mountains.

It will, he has argued, not succeed in creating a 'gathbandhan' of the electorate. At a time when there is speculation about the government's key agenda for the next elections, Modi has also said that his campaign platform for 2019 will be ‘all-round development, quick development, and development for all'. With this, Modi has indicated the two central planks of his campaign in the 2014 elections-a strong, decisive government and vikas (development)-will be his themes once again. In written responses to a wide range of questions from Hindustan Times, Modi spoke about the political challenge in 2019, defended his government's record on the economy, and articulated a broad worldview on relations with major powers, particularly the US, Russia and China. When asked about the prospects of a grand Opposition alliance, which observers consider a powerful challenge because it can prevent the fragmentation of the anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vote, Modi said that after a long time, a ‘performing, strong and stable’ government was in power in Delhi. ‘People have seen the benefits of such a dispensation. People also have a very bitter experience of coalition governments in the past that were burdened by coalition politics of compulsions.

An AFP correspondent at the site in Sarmada in Idlib province near the Turkish border said the explosion of unknown origin caused two buildings to collapse. Rescue workers used a bulldozer to remove rubble and extract trapped people, the correspondent said. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor, said a previous toll of 12 civilians killed increased after more bodies were retrieved from the rubble. ‘The explosion occurred in a weapons depot in a residential building in Sarmada,’ said the head of the Britain-based monitor, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria. But the cause of the blast was ‘not yet clear’, Abdel Rahman added. He said most of those killed were family members of fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance led by jihadists from Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate, who had been displaced to the area from the central province of Homs. A rescue worker carried the motionless body of a small child from the wreckage to an ambulance, the AFP correspondent said.

The civil rights movement in the United States is about the campaign of African Americans. Because of their skin color, they did not have the same rights that white people did for a long time. This injustice on African Americans led to a time of social unrest. In the 1950's and 1960's, blacks rose up to fight against the social systems and public authorities that had taken these rights away. Many whites supported their campaign. After the Civil War (1861-65), slavery was ended and African Americans were made citizens and got the right to vote. However, there was so much prejudice against blacks that these new laws were often ignored. In the southern states many laws were passed that separatedblacks from whites in public. They were treated as second class citizens. The modern civil rights movement began in the 1950s. In 1955, a black woman in Alabama named Rosa Parks refused to give her seat on a bus to a white man. For this act of protest, Parks was arrested. The blacks no longer wanted to ‘sit at the back of the bus,’ and started a boycott of the bus system. They chose a young minister, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to lead their protest. The Montgomery boycott was very important for the African Americans. It encouraged them in other cities to protest for civil rights. Dr. King was a great spokesperson who spoke out on radio and television programs and urged blacks to take part in so-called freedom rides and sit-ins. Dr. King and thousands of others were often put into prison for these protests. On August 28, 1963, more than 200,000 Americans of all races gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

The northern states, under, President Abraham Lincoln, were against slavery. Although the Confederates won some early battles the Union became stronger and defeated the southern states in 1865. The Civil War was fought mainly because the two sides had different opinions about slavery. The southern states depended on farming as a source of income. They grew tobacco and cotton on plantations. Between the 17th and 19th centuries millions of slaves were brought from Africa to America, where they worked on white farms. The southern states wanted to keep their slaves because they thought that without free workers they could not sell their products at a competitive price. The North, on the other hand, was an industrial region, where slavery lost its importance during the 19th century. Farmers in the northern states had small farms that used paid workers although slavery was the main issue that led to the outbreak of the American Civil War there were other causes for the conflict. People in the north lived in big cities while southerners lived isolated on farms. European immigrants chose to live in the northern states where they could get better jobs and where the economy developed more quickly. The southern states also demanded more rights from the federal government. There were also differing opinions on whether new states that joined the Union should allow slavery or not.

Many of the countries that were once British are now independent states and belong to an organization called the Commonwealth of Nations. The modern Commonwealth was formed 60 years ago although the first attempts to create such an organization are older. After the end of the Second World War Britain saw itself in the middle of a new world order. Its empire was falling apart and colonies all over the world were becoming independent. Even though the British monarchy was desperately trying to keep up good relationships with its former colonies, not all of them wanted this. On the one side it India could be persuaded to stay on board, but other nations, like Ireland, left as soon as they got the chance. In the following years colonies like Burma and Sudan refused to join. The Persian Gulf states, which had been under British rule for a long time before the war, also stayed out of the club. The worst period for the Commonwealth followed in the 60s, 70s and 80s. The organization nearly fell apart because of the white governments in Rhodesia and South Africa. When Rhodesia declared its independence many Africans thought that the British army should invade. South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 and Black African countries boycotted the apartheid nation. The Commonwealth was shaken again when Britain joined the European Common Market in 1973.

Communism is based on the theories of Karl Marx, a German philosopher and revolutionary. He was an enemy of capitalism, a system that was spreading rapidly throughout the Industrial Revolution and the 19th century. Marx was angry to see that some capitalists became rich while other people had nothing. Factory workers were paid poorly and had to work under extreme conditions. Marx started spreading socialist ideas in which he demanded that the government take over property and factories and divide wealth more evenly among the population. He wrote down his ideas in the publication Communist Manifesto. Karl Marx believed that one day the workers would one day take control of government and the economy. That would be the start of a Communist society in which there were no classes and everyone had the same. A drastic change in economy is the most important principal of communism. The government controls economy and businesses. They nationalize all industries and factories. Government planning organizations decide what kind of products should be produced and how they are to be distributed. Prices are defined by the government and do not depend on supply and demand, as in Capitalist societies. Workers earn the same, regardless of their position. There are not very many differences between the highest and lowest wages. In the early years of Communism, planned economy was successful. The government could concentrate on building up different sections of the economy, like energy or industries.",
        "Topic54":"After being in exile for 50 years the question is becoming more and more important among Tibetans. Will the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, ever return to his home country? The Chinese authorities are expecting protests throughout Tibet and have sent police and army units into the region. The government has also forbidden foreigners to enter the region. In the meantime the 74-year old Dalai Lama does not expect to return to Tibet anytime soon. He admits that he has not succeeded in getting Beijing to give the region more rights. The Tibetan leader accuses the Chinese government of committing cultural genocide and fears that Tibet's ancient culture may disappear forever. On the other hand the Beijing government has claimed that since the Dalai Lama was overthrown and left the country 50 years ago Tibet has become a more modern society. The Dalai Lama still hopes to return to Tibet one day. When that day comes he has promised to return his power to create a local government under Chinese rule. At the same time he is afraid that his return from exile may lead to more anti-Chinese feelings and discontent may spread. In Tibet the Dalai Lama is the central figure around which everything revolves. Many Tibetans want him back, even if it means more trouble with the Chinese. However, there may not be very much time left. The Dalai Lama is getting older and his health is not always at its best. Last year he spent many weeks in an Indian hospital. He has also called off meetings, lectures and trips to other countries. Political experts think that Beijing is not really looking for a solution to the issue, but simply waiting for the Dalai Lama to die. His successor would not be as popular as he is. The Chinese, however, are aware that they shouldn't provoke the people as they stand behind their Dalai Lama.",

Nobody really knew what it was. By the time he died in 1882 scientists were able to explain light and electromagnetic waves. And, thanks to Darwin, biologists were able to explain how life on Earth developed. Darwin was the best biologist of all times. He was an expert on plants, animals and insects. But he didn't want to be a biologist at first. At school and the university Darwin was just an average student. He read a lot and collected beetles and butterflies. He went to Edinburgh to study medicine but soon found out that it wasn't the right thing for him. At Cambridge he met a fellow botanist, John Steven Henslow. Henslow helped him get a job on the exploration ship Beagle. The ship travelled around the world for five years and Darwin learned a lot about the forms of life. When Darwin returned to England he was a well-known scientist who lived an isolated life in the countryside where he did experiments and studied plants and animals. Darwin read a lot of interesting books. One of them influenced him a great deal. A popular economist claimed that when the population grew the people would need more and more food. But there was not enough for everybody, so food would become scarce and not everyone could survive and have children. Darwin thought that this had to be true for animals and plants as well. Those that had food would survive and the others would die. Charles Darwin-Father of Evolution. This helped Darwin solve many questions of life. While many scientists thought that all animals and plants had always been the same Darwin wasn't sure about this. During his voyage on the Beagle he began to think about it.",
        "Topic56":"With over a third of its land below sea level, the Netherlands have been fighting against the sea for hundreds of years. Over the centuries they have built dykes, dams and windmills to stop sea water from getting into the country. The last big disaster occurred in 1953. A storm that swept across the North Sea killed over 2000 people and flooded thousands of square kilometres of land. After this catastrophe something had to be done. A new plan, called the Delta Works, created a series of dams, locks, dykes and other barriers to protect the coastal areas from the sea. The mouths of the major rivers were closed and the coastline was shortened by about 500 km. As a result the water behind the dams turned into freshwater lakes. It took over 30 years to complete the Delta Works and officials say it is the world's best defense system. In addition, old dykes have been improved and made higher. Only a great storm that happens once in 10, 000 years can break them. The final part of the Delta Works, the Maeslant Barrier was opened in 1997. It was originally intended to keep sea water out of Rotterdam's Europort harbor, most of which lies below sea level. But it also protects the surrounding towns and the farming land around it. When sea levels rise by 3 meters the two semi-circular gates of the 300 meter wide barrier close automatically. It is expected that the barrier will close once every ten years because of large storms but in the next 50 years it will probably close even more often. Near the coast sea levels have gone up about 20 cm in the last hundred years. If experts are right the sea near the Netherlands may rise up to 1.3 meters by the end of the century. In 2007 the barrier passed its first test and closed because of a storm.",
        "Topic57":"Developing countries are the poor countries of our world. While most of them are located in many parts of Africa and Asia, some countries in South and Central America are also referred to as developing countries. About 70% of the world's 7 billion people live in underdeveloped countries. Many of these nations have an economy that is based on farming. They do not produce enough of the goods that their growing population needs. As a result, many people in developing countries live in poverty. In developing countries, governments control many sectors of the economy. Industries, banks and the energy sector often belong to the state. Today, some countries are slowly opening up to foreign investment. They are allowing private companies and businesspersons to bring in money to finance various projects. In the last few decades, countries around the world have grown from developing countries to fully industrialised nations. In Asia, for example, the so-called ‘Four Tigers’ South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan-managed to develop to industrial nations between the 1960s and the 1990s. Drawing a line between developed nations and developing countries is not very easy. Some countries are in-between, but still growing at a rapid pace. Among them are China, Brazil, India, Mexico and others. Economic experts use the GDP per capita of a country to determine whether it is a developing country or not. While the wealthiest countries of the world have a GDP of over 40,000 US dollars, most of the poorest countries are under $1,000 per year. Countries with a GDP per capital of under $4,000 are referred to as developing countries. Low income-Developing countries get most of their income from selling farming products and raw materials. They often do not have industries that produce expensive goods for the world markets. People live in poverty because they do not have the money to buy everyday goods.",
        "Topic58":"As the first decade of the new millennium comes to an end more and more countries are waiting in line to get into the European Union. Turkey, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia are all potential candidates who may be joining sooner or later. Other countries, like Georgia and the Ukraine will have to do a lot more before they can be considered real candidates. The last big enlargement of the European Union took place five years ago, when 10 countries, most of them from Eastern Europe, joined. Three years later Romania and Bulgaria followed. Joining the European community is probably the top goal of any politician. But what does a candidate country have to do in order to join? Above all, they have to fight corruption and crime, accept the European Union's laws and open up their economies. In return they can expect lots of trade and foreign investors. On average the European Union has welcomed new members about every eight years. At the moment, however, most of the candidate countries are stuck with the economic crisis. That is one of the reasons why enlargement is moving on very slowly. On the other hand western European countries are not very happy about enlarging the European Union too quickly. Some of the new member states have not yet caught up to western standards and citizens in traditional EU counties are blaming the newcomers for, at least, part of the current crisis. The biggest problem for the EU appears to be Turkey. Because of its 70 million Muslims, many countries like Germany, Austria or France doubt whether it should join at all. They have many immigrants from Turkey in their countries already and fear that opening up borders completely may lead to a mass immigration. Some existing EU members have their own internal disputes with potential candidates. EU-member Slovenia is quarrelling with Croatia about sea borders between the two states.",
        "Topic59":"Why do human beings look a bit like monkey or apes? Why are dolphin’s good swimmers? Why do giraffes have long necks? The answer to all these questions is evolution. Evolution is the way life changes through time. All living things are connected together like branches in a tree. Plants and animals are related to one another through their ancestors. For example, we share a common ancestor with gorillas, dogs or even mushrooms. Evolution shows us how and why all living things change over a certain period of time. We cannot watch changes in life directly. They take place over thousands or millions of years. However, scientists cannot find proof that these changes have taken place. Important evidence for evolution comes from fossils, the leftovers of ancient life. When animals or plants die they are pressed into sand or clay. Over millions of years rocks are formed. Fossils Scientists have found out those different fossils are found in rocks of different ages. For example, the oldest rocks of our earth are about 3.8 billion years old. They contain no fossils because there was probably no life at that time. Fossils of bacteria appear in rocks that are about 3.5 billion years old. Fish, reptile and mammal fossils appear in younger rocks. Human fossils are found only in the youngest and highest rock layers. Fossils also show that certain groups of animals have evolved from other groups. Amphibians evolved from fish that could breathe air and move on land. They had legs but also scales and a fin. Birds probably evolved from dinosaurs. The archaeopteryx was an animal that had feathers like a bird and could fly. It also had teeth, claws on its wings and a skeleton that looked like a meat-eating dinosaur. But even without fossils there is other proof which shows that evolution has taken place. Different species often have similar features which they probably got from a common.",

In a blog post, the site's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, states that Facebook will continue to work as hard as it has in the last five years in order to stay the web's number one communication site. The company started in a dorm room in 2004. Today it has 150 million active users, more than the 130 million of rival MySpace. Facebook is different from other social networking sites because you can communicate with people you really know and trust. Before, most people didn't want to share their real identities online. Facebook has given people a safe and trusted environment for people to interact online. It has changed the way people view the world. A friend from any country is only a few clicks away. It was back in February 2004 when Zuckerberg started ‘The Facebook’ from a Harvard student's room. The aim was to help students get in touch with each other over the Internet. Within 24 hours over a thousand students had signed up and soon after that the network spread out to other universities. By 2005 a research study showed that about 85% of the students in the network had a Facebook account. Another survey showed that Facebook was almost as important as an iPod. At the end of 2005 Facebook came to the U.K. and up to today the site has been translated into 35 languages. Five years after its start Facebook has escaped the universities and colleges. More than half of its users are not at college anymore and the fastest growing group are the 30 to 40 year olds. Every day 15 million users update their profiles to tell their friends and the world what's happening to them. They also share photos, upload videos, chat, make friends, join groups and simply have fun.",
        "Topic61":"Factory farming is a method of mass food production in which animals are kept in very confined areas in order to get the best possible profit. Factory farming wants to keep production costs low and sell cheaper food to consumers. Factory farming is a much discussed issue. Animal rights activists and environmentalists claim that this type of food production is dangerous to our environment and forces animals to live in an unworthy way. On the other side farmers and larger food corporations claim that they cannot produce enough food at reasonable prices without factory farming. Over the past decades farms have grown in size and intensity. Farming has become an industry, using modern technology. Today farmers use pesticides, antibiotics and vitamins to produce as much as they can and to control diseases. Fertilizers make it possible to grow more crops than nature would allow. These factors lead to lower food prices on supermarket shelves. Those who are in favour of factory farming say that it creates jobs and lets consumers buy cheaper food. They also state that it is friendly to our nature because it uses less land to produce the same amount of food. Critics against factory farming say that it is brutal and cruel to animals. They live in overcrowded cages or boxes without enough space to move around. Chicken, sheep, cattle and pigs are often kept in such a way. They are given special feed so that they can grow quicker. Crops that are sprayed with pesticides are a health risk to humans and have a number of chemicals in them. They also argue that such large farms ruin smaller ones because they can produce at more competitive prices. Although products from factory farms are not labelled consumers can buy food from organic production.",
        "Topic62":"The Falklands are a group of islands located in the southern Atlantic Ocean, about 460 km east of the South American coast. They belong to the United Kingdom but govern themselves. The Falkland Islands have been an issue of conflict between Argentina and Great Britain over the centuries, resulting in a war between the two countries in 1982. About 3,000 people live on the Falklands, most of whom are British citizens. The island group is ruled by the Queen who sends a governor to administer the territory. 380 children who live on the Falklands are given an education according to the British school system. After attending school up to the age of 16 they can go to England to take their A-levels. The Falkland Islands consist of two main islands and hundreds of smaller ones. The coastline has rough with many fjords, bays and inlets. The climate is influenced by its southern location near the Antarctic continent. Summer temperatures average 13Â°C in January while winter temperatures drop to 4Â°C in July. The islands are often hit by storms and heavy rainfall. More than 90% of the islands are farmland. Fishing and sheep farming are the main sources of income for the Falkland Islanders. Its high quality wool is exported to the UK. In the last few years tourism has increased, largely because of cruise tours that visit the Falklands for its unique scenery and wildlife. During the centuries a number of European nations founded settlements on the Falkland Islands. In 1833 Britain took command over the group of islands and set up a naval station there. In the second half of the 20 th century argument erupted between Great Britain and Argentina over the colony. Since the 19th century Argentina has claimed the islands. It states that it got the islands from Spain when it became independent in 1816. On April 2, 1982 Argentine forces invaded and occupied the islands.",
        "Topic63":"Fascism is a political system in which the state has all the power. All citizens must work for the country and the government. A dictator or another powerful person is the head of such a state. He uses a strong army and a police force to keep law and order. He is often a strong, authoritarian leader who is, at the beginning, admired by many people. Fascism first appeared after World War I when Benito Mussolini came to power in Italy. In Germany of the 1930s Adolf Hitler's National Socialism rose to power. Fascism also appeared in Japan, Spain and Argentina. Life in a Fascist Regime Fascist governments control the way people live. Those who criticize the government or do not obey are punished. They must leave the country, go to prison or are often executed. Fascist leaders want to make their state strong and powerful. They claim that only the strongest and fittest in the population can survive. With the help of a strong army they go to war and expand their territory. School teachers show children that only the state is important. Pupils must exercise to stay healthy. Young organizations are often created in which children admire the state and learn slogans and songs. They are trained to march and follow the beliefs of the ruling party. Fascist governments try to give all people work, mainly in the industries they need. They build roads, hospitals and industries which help them rise to power. In fascist countries no other political parties are allowed. The government controls newspapers, radio and television. There is no freedom of speech. Fascism became a strong movement during the first part of the 20th century for many reasons. Most states had no experience with democracy because they were ruled by a king or queen.",
        "Topic64":"First aid is the help that you give someone quickly after they have hurt themselves or have had an accident. It can stop a person from becoming more ill. In some cases, it can even save a person's life. Only someone who knows first aid well should try to treat an injured or sick person. Usually, you give first aid until a doctor or an ambulance arrives. Never try to give someone first aid unless you know what to do. The wrong actions can do more harm than good. When someone has been hurt or has had an accident, the first thing to do is get help. If you don't know the phone number of the local doctor or hospital dials an emergency number: 144 for an ambulance, 133 for the fire department and 122 for the police. When you call for help you should be able to give correct information. An ambulance needs to know where the injured person is located and what exactly has happened. In some cases, you will be given instructions on what to do until a doctor or ambulance arrives. Sometimes you cannot wait until help arrives. You must begin helping a person at once, especially if the victim is bleeding strongly, has been poisoned or if breathing has stopped. Even if you wait for a short time, this can be fatal. Here are some important rules for immediate help do not move a person who may have a broken bone, internal injuries or an injured spine unless you really have to. If the victim is lying down, keep the person in that position. Do not allow them to walk or stand up. Never give food or liquid to a person who may need an operation. If the victim is unconscious turn the head to one side to keep the person from choking. But do not move the head of a person who may have any serious injury or illness may lead to shock. When a person is in shock blood does not carry enough oxygen and food to the brain and other organs. A victim who suffers from shock may look afraid, confused and weak and be extremely thirsty. The skin appears pale and feels cold. Pulse and breathing are fast. To treat shock, place the victim on his or her back and raise the legs a little. Warm the victim by putting blankets around them. Strong bleeding can cause death in minutes. Bleeding from small wounds usually stops after a short time because the blood clots. But clotting cannot stop the flow of blood when a wound is big. The best way to stop bleeding is to press on the wound itself. If possible let the person lie down and raise the bleeding part of the body. Then put a sterile handkerchief, cloth or towel on the wound and press it down with your hand. Do with for 10 to 20 minutes until help arrives. Sometimes direct pressure cannot stop strong bleeding. If the leg or arm is hurt you can try to stop bleeding by putting pressure on the artery that carries blood to the injured body part. There are four ways in which a victim may be poisoned. Poison may be swallowed, inhaled, injected or absorbed through the skin. If a poison victim becomes unconscious or has difficulty breathing call for an ambulance immediately. A person who has swallowed something poisonous may die within minutes if they are not treated. The first step is to find out what kind of poison the person has swallowed. Call a doctor or a poison control centre immediately and follow the instructions that you are given carefully. If a person has inhaled a poison like carbon monoxide or chlorine gas move him or her to fresh air at once. Open all doors and windows. Injected poisons are those that come from insect stings or bites. If you are stung by a bee the stinger remains in the wound. Remove it carefully and put ice on the sting or run cold water over it. If a person is bitten by a tick pull out the remaining part carefully and slowly. Use a glove or something else but not your bare hands. Do not try to burn it off or put oil on it. If a rash or flulike symptoms develop in the following weeks contact a doctor. Sometimes a victim may have an allergy towards bite or stings. In such a case either call a doctor, an ambulance or take the person to the nearest hospital. Poisons can also be absorbed through the skin if you get in contact with poisonous plants or chemical substances. In such a case remove all the clothes that someone is wearing and flush the skin with water for about 10 minutes.",

Fish first appeared in the oceans of the Earth about 500 million years ago, long before dinosaurs roamed our planet. Today there are tens of thousands of different kinds of fish and new species are discovered every year. Over millions of years fish have changed their features and adapted to their surroundings in order to survive. The whale shark is the largest fish on Earth. It can grow up to 12 meters in length and can weigh up to 15 tons. In contrast tiny gobies are often only a few mm long. Fish are important to people. They were among the first animals hunted by primitive human beings. Millions of people all over the world depend on fish as a main form of nutrition. In many coastal countries, for example Japan or Norway, people depend on fishing to make a living. Fish are a part of the food chain. They eat animals and are eaten by other sea creatures, thus keeping up the balance of nature. Fish live all over the world, in the cold water of the Arctic as well as in warm tropical water around the equator. Areas rich in fish are especially around the coastal shelves of the Northern Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the western Pacific Ocean. Most of the world's fish live in salt water. They preferably live in areas where warm and cold currents meet. Some types live in the warm tropical waters around coral reefs. About 40% of all fish species are in fresh water. They include carp, catfish, trout or bass. Some of them live in the clear water of rivers while others prefer muddy pond water. A few types of fish can swim in both salt and fresh water. Salmon, for example, are born in fresh water, migrate.",
        "Topic67":"A flood is a body of water that covers land which is normally dry. Floods are common natural disasters that can affect millions of people around the world. They destroy houses and buildings, and carry soil away from valuable farming land. Floods can also contaminate drinking water and lead to diseases. They are often caused by rivers, but overflowing lakes and seas can also cause flooding. Flooding has always been a part human history. Many ancient civilizations developed along waterways and rivers because people needed water for their fields. Floods are not always destructive natural events. Before the Assuan High Dam was built yearly floods in Egypt brought along nutrients and made the land around the Nile very fertile. Every year floods during the monsoon season in Bangladesh deposit fertile soil but also kill thousands of people and leave millions homeless. At least once a year the plains around large rivers are flooded. This is due to the amount of water that rivers bring with them, because of heavy rainfall or melting snow in the mountainous regions. Thunderstorms can cause flash floods, in which small rivers can swell quickly and carry up to ten times the normal amount of water. Rivers that flow slowly carry water, sand and silt. They build up their own beds, making them higher than the land around them. The Huang He, or Yellow River, in China and the Mississippi in North America are examples for such rivers. Flooding here builds up slowly but causes more damage because more land is affected. Coastal regions can also be affected by flooding. After earthquakes on the ocean floor tsunamis can bring up to 15-metre high waves and flood the coast many miles inland. In 2004, a devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean killed over 250,000 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other countries. Tropical storms, cyclones and hurricanes also lead to flooding.

At 27 he overthrew the Libyan king when he was in Turkey for medical treatment. During the last few years of his rule Gaddafi tried to gain international recognition and become a statesman. Gaddafi was born in the desert town of Sirte. He came from a Bedouin family who led a nomadic life style. After he had gone to a military college he went to Britain for army training. On September 1, 1969 he overthrew the monarch and became what he called the revolutionary leader of Libya. Although Gaddafi officially set up peoples' committees he gave them virtually no power. People who thought otherwise were sent to prison or killed. Many of them were tortured or simply disappeared. The media was under the control of the colonel. Gaddafi's ideology is presented in his Green Book, in which he creates a mixture of capitalism and socialism combined with Islamic ideas. Gaddafi was well-known for his 40 female body guards who he chose himself. Instead of wearing a suit he often wore stylish clothes with sunglasses. Political guests were welcomed in heavily guarded tents instead of state palaces. In the past decades Col Gaddafi tried to gain influence in many parts of Northern Africa. In the 70s he sent an army to Chad and during the 80s Libya was host to rebel and terrorist groups. Over the years western countries have been against Gaddafi's regime because they say he supported militant groups like the IRA or the PLO. Relationships with the west worsened towards the middle of the 1980s. Gaddafi's regime was made responsible for terrorist attacks all over the world.

The spacecraft was launched from the cosmodrome in Baikonur. The journey itself lasted 108 minutes. For the first time in history man had freed himself from the earth's gravity. Gagarin was the son of a carpenter. His mother worked as a milkmaid. When the Germans occupied their village during World War II the family were forced out of their home and lived in a hut nearby. In school Gagarin's favourite subjects were mathematics and physics. Yuri went on to a technical college where he became interested in flying. After graduating from pilot school Gagarin became a fighter pilot for the Soviet Air Force. Over 20 candidates were trained for the Soviet Union's first manned space mission. The son of a worker was chosen because the Soviet Union wanted to show the west that, in a socialist society, everyone could succeed, even those from poorer families. When Gagarin's Vostok spacecraft lifted off on the morning of April 12, 1961 Gagarin was only a passenger. He could not control anything on board Vostok 1. Although the flight was a success, the west found out later that Gagarin was close to being killed. The service module did not separate from the capsule on its return to earth. Temperatures in the capsule got very high and Gagarin said he was engulfed in a cloud of fire when returning to earth. Shortly before the capsule crashed on the ground Gagarin was able to eject and return to earth with a parachute. The Soviet Union kept Gagarin's flight secret until it was almost over because they feared something might go wrong and the Communist superpower would be humiliated.

The region has been troubled by many conflicts and wars throughout the centuries. It has often been called the ‘Powder Keg of Europe’ because conflicts and wars have started there. The countries that make up the Balkans are Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia Herzegovina. Sometimes parts of Croatia, and Slovenia as well as Romania are considered to belong to the Balkans. The Balkans are a mountainous region. The Dinaric Alps, the main mountain range, reach from Croatia to Greece along the Adriatic Sea. The Balkan Mountains are somewhat lower and extend from Serbia eastwards into Bulgaria. The southern section of the Carpathian Mountains reaches into Romania and Serbia. The Danube, the region's main waterway, flows through many countries of the Balkans into the Black Sea. Its broad plains provide fertile fields for farming. Most of the Balkans has a harsh, continental climate with hot, dry summers and cold winters. The coastal regions are influenced by the Mediterranean Sea. The peninsula was once covered with many forests. However, over the centuries, they have been cut down to make room for settlements and agriculture. Most of them region's 80 million people are Slavs, who are divided into different ethnic groups. They live in Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro. Albanians, Greeks and Romanians do not belong to the Slavic population. The three large groups-Serbs, Croats and Bosnians fought against each other for many years after the breakup of former Yugoslavia. The Balkans is also the crossroads of major religions. Roman Catholics live in in Slovenia and Croatia; Orthodox Christians populate Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania. Muslims live in large areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Albania. Smaller groups, including Romani, are spread across all of the Balkans. The Balkans belong to the poorer regions of Europe. Only Romania, with large deposits of oil and gas, has important raw materials. A large part of the population makes their living through farming and raising animals.

They have been on earth long before there were any other organisms. Bacteria are so small you can only see them with the help of a microscope. They have only one cell and very simple structures. Bacteria have outer cell walls that protect the inside. A cell membrane is inside the cell wall. It prevents harmful substances from getting in and out. Inside the membrane is a soft, jelly-like substance called the cytoplasm. It has chemicals that help build the parts of a cell and break down food. Within it is the nucleoid, which contains the DNA. It controls a cell's growth and other activities Bacteria appear in different shapes. Spherical bacteria are round or ball-like. Rod-shaped bacteria live in your intestine and form chains. Spiral-shaped bacteria have a twisted form. Bacteria absorb nutrients and remove waste through their cell walls. They reproduce by splitting themselves in the middle. The two new cells can then split into four cells and so on. In a short time a single bacteria can reproduce billions of times. Some bacteria can get inside the human body, reproduce and cause an infection. These harmful bacteria are called pathogens. Our immune system is in charge of fighting off these bacteria. However, sometimes we need a vaccine to help fight off these intruders. Vaccines are weak or dead forms of the bacteria itself. Such a substance helps our body fight off bacteria in the future. Some examples of illnesses caused by bacterial infections are tuberculosis or pneumonia. The best way to protect yourself from bacteria is to keep yourself clean and wash your hands. Because bacteria may be transported by air, we should cover our nose and mouth when we sneeze. Vitamins also help strengthen our immune system and fight off bacteria. Bacteria can be helpful to the human body as well. They live in our stomach and help us digest food. Other bacteria create cheese and yoghurt.

Arab merchants brought them to northern Africa and the Middle East. Portuguese navigators discovered bananas when they sailed down the Atlantic coast of Africa. From there they were brought to the Canary Islands, from where Spaniards took them to the New World. Although bananas grow like trees they are actually plants. They are made up of stalks that are covered with overlapping leaves. A stalk or stem can be about 30 cm thick. A banana plant can grow up to 6 meters in height. It has up to 20 long and wide leaves. Bananas hang in clusters, also called hands, from the plant. Each cluster can carry about 10 to 20 bananas. Bananas need good, well-drained soils, as well as a warm tropical climate with enough rainfall to grow. They are often cultivated on plantations, often with hundreds of workers who cultivate and harvest bananas for the world market. These large farms sell their products to large companies like, Chiquita and Dole. The first banana fruits can grow about a year after planting. Bananas are endangered by temperatures below zero and strong winds. Diseases, like the Panama disease, an infection of the soil, can completely destroy banana crops. Bananas are harvested while they are still green. In this state the banana's flesh is white and cannot be eaten. The green fruits are taken to the nearest port, where they are put on container ships with cooling containers on board. When the bananas arrive at their destination they are loaded onto trucks or railway cars and brought to sellers who store them in special ripening rooms. From this time on it takes bananas about five days to ripen and get the yellow colour and taste we all know. As the fruit ripens the flesh also becomes sweet. In many tropical regions of Africa, South America and Asia, bananas are a main food for the population. They have many nutrients that people need. In addition to 75% water, a banana contains sugar, proteins and vitamins. It gives you quick energy and can be digested fairly easily. Bananas belong to the healthiest foods in the world. They contain potassium, which can lower your blood pressure, prevent heart diseases and reduce the risk of a stroke. In the western world bananas are eaten as snacks in-between meals or together with cereals. In other countries they are used to make wine or beer.",
        "Topic73":"During the 14th century about 25 million people died from a disease that became known as the plague, or Black Death. It swept through Europe and killed about 40% of the continent's population. Historians think the Black Death originated in Central Asia. Rats and fleas spread the infectious disease. In 1347 the plague hit Messina in Sicily and soon spread to cities all over the Mediterranean Sea. It struck London in 1348 and Scandinavia and Russia soon after that. Doctors at that time did not know the cause of the disease. They could not prevent it from spreading and didn't have any cure. It caused panic among the population and many people tried desperately to save themselves. In Spain, France and Germany people accused the Jews of poisoning wells to spread the disease. Others thought that the plague was God's punishment. The symptoms were horrible Tumours, sometimes as big as an egg or an apple, as well as purple dots covered the whole body. People showed swellings in their lymph nodes and smelled badly because they were rotting from the inside. Widespread fever drove people mad, wandering around and shouting in the streets. Many infected vomited and coughed up blood. When the symptoms appeared the victim only had a few days left to live. There wasn't enough space in the graveyards, so the bodies were often left on the streets. The population used strange methods to fight against the plague. Fires were started to clean the air and people took scents, like rosemary, amber with them. Some put wooden frames over their windows to stop the polluted air from coming in. Most of the population didn't eat meat. Those who could fled to the countryside where there were not so many people who were infected. In order to control the disease people were quarantined and many areas built public hospitals for all people. Once it hit Europe the Black Death moved fast and travelled at an average speed of 4km a day. By 1352 the plague slowly lost its muscle. Those who survived lost faith in the church because God turned against them. People started to celebrate because they had survived, drank wildly and organized death dances. The plague returned to Europe in following centuries but it was not as devastating as during the 14th century. The Black Death changed Europe completely. There were not enough people to work anymore so labour became more expensive. Some villages in the countryside even disappeared.",
        "Topic74":"Blood is an important fluid that keeps us alive. We cannot live without it. The heart pumps blood to all parts of the body and brings them oxygen and food. At the same time blood carries all the substances we don't need away from us. Blood fights infections, keeps our body temperature the same and carries chemicals that control body functions. Finally, blood has substances that repair broken blood vessels so that we don't bleed to death. Plasma is the liquid part of our blood. It makes up about 50-60% of it. Plasma consists mostly of water but many other substances are in it. It contains dissolved food, chemicals that control our growth and do other jobs, proteins, minerals and waste products. Red blood cells look like flat round discs. They contain haemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen to the body and gives blood its red colour. Each drop of blood has about 300 million of these red cells. White blood cells, also called leukocytes, fight infections and harmful substances that invade the body. Most of these cells are round and colourless. They have different sizes and shapes. White blood cells are not as numerous as red ones. For every 700 red blood cells there is only one white blood cell. Platelets are tiny bodies that are much smaller than red blood cells. They stick to the edges of a cut and form blood clots to stop bleeding. The blood of a normal adult has about 2trillion platelets. The circulatory system carries blood to all parts of your body. The heart pumps blood through big blood vessels called arteries and veins. In our body there are also millions of small blood vessels called capillaries. Oxygen, food and other substances pass through the thin walls of these capillaries into the tissue. When you inhale air oxygen passes through your lungs and is picked up by haemoglobin which transports it to your whole body. It is released into cells which produce energy. In return cells produce carbon dioxide which enters your blood stream and is transported back to your lungs where it is exhaled. Food also reaches your body by means of blood. It is digested in your stomach and important substances like fat, sugar, proteins, vitamins and minerals are separated. These nutrients enter your blood stream and are moved to the cells and muscles where they are needed in order to give you energy or fuel. The work of the muscles and other tissue creates heat. Blood is the transporting system which carries heat throughout your body and warms you. The things that you don't need are transported to your intestines and kidneys and leave your body again. White blood cells play an important role in your immune system. When harmful substances invade your body an alarm goes off and white blood cells are activated. Then they work to destroy the invaders. They fight off viruses, harmful bacteria and begin anti-body production. Blood also carries hormones to places where they are needed. When a hormone reaches a part of the body it controls growth, how the body uses food and other things. You would bleed to death from a small cut if your blood didn't clot. When a blood vessel breaks platelets rush to the damaged area and stick to one another, forming a plug. Blood cells come from bone marrow. They begin as stem cells and then develop into red or white blood cells, or platelets. They don't live forever and must be replaced by new ones. Red blood cells live an average of 120days before wearing out. Then they are captured and destroyed in the liver and spleen. Platelets live only for about 10days. The amount of blood in your body depends on your size, weight and the altitude at which you live. An adult who weighs 80 kg has about 5 litres of blood, a 40 kg child about half the amount. People who live in high areas where the air is thinner need more blood to deliver more oxygen to the body.",
        "Topic75":"It's a far cry from the clean, mechanized mines of South Africa, but it's how much of Africa's gem stones are mined: men dig by hand in pits, gravel and stream beds, looking for telltale signs of that elusive stone that will make them rich-or at least bring in enough money to sustain them and maybe secure the family's future. Over one million diggers search for diamonds this way in Africa. They make less than a dollar a day, while the global diamond trade nets an estimated $80 billion a year. But, economic woes are not the only human toll of the gem industry. In countries like Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sierra Leone, diamonds were used by armed militias and rebels to fan civil war and inflict misery on the population. These became known as ‘blood diamonds. Global Witness was one of the first non-governmental organizations to focus on the issue. Speaking with VOA in London, Annie Dunnebacke says the group set out to document the tragedy of conflict diamonds. Sierra Leone is one of the most notorious cases where hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of the conflict that saw the eastern part of the country, where the diamond fields are, controlled by the Revolutionary United Front, a rebel group backed by then Liberian president Charles Taylor, says Dunnebacke. Horrific destruction and havoc was wreaked, especially upon the civilian population really, because the diamonds represented an economic incentive for the war to continue. Panning for diamonds in Sierra Leone Panning for diamonds in Sierra Leone-USAID Guinea. The horrors of that war shocked the public, especially the scenes of innocent men, women and children with their limbs cut off by rebels, and youngsters being forced into combat. Efforts to publicize the link between the atrocities, the warlords and the diamonds paid off. The movie Blood Diamonds helped. In it, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an ex-mercenary who sells arms to Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for diamonds. In the end, though, he gives up the business and helps publicize the illicit trade. Global Witness was an advisor on the film, and Annie Dunnebacke says it had an impact. I think bringing the message in sort of Hollywood terms to a much wider audience than possibly our reports get to, it does have value, she says. Eventually, international pressure made the diamond industry sit up and listen. In 2003, the Kimberley Process came into being. It requires member governments to certify that exports and imports are free from blood diamonds. Industry associations said they would comply. Tom Tweedy is a spokesman for DeBeers, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds. He says the Kimberley Process is a good way forward. We have a system, and however imperfect it may be, it is probably the only comprehensive system of its type in the world, says Tweedy. At the World Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Director Philip Claes says that before the Kimberley Process, conflict diamonds accounted for 4 to 15 % of rough diamonds traded worldwide. Today, conflict diamonds account for only 0.2 % of all rough diamonds traded worldwide, says Claes. The emphasis is on certifying the origin of the diamonds to weed out goods traded illegally. Annie Dunnebacke of Global Witness says it's a good start but there are loopholes. There are huge weaknesses ranging obviously from porous borders in African artisanal producing countries and basic lack of infrastructure, corruption, things like this which are stopping the scheme from being implemented effectively, things that encourage a lot of smuggling, cross-border smuggling, ‘she says. In Johannesburg, diamond trader Janine Chaveau agrees. ‘I know quite a few people who are multi-millionaires who have never dealt in legal diamonds,’ she says, ‘it's always been illegal, blood diamonds.’",
        "Topic76":"40 years ago the Boeing 747 made its first flight across the skies of Washington State. It lasted a total of 75 minutes. In the forty years that followed, the 747 became an icon of travel and helped bring mass tourism to many countries around the world. Many features made the 747 a unique airplane. It was the first airplane with a wide body and with more than one aisle. Although this is a normal feature in today's long-distance jets it was something very new at the time. Everything was so big and you had the feeling that you were in a large room. It was the first three-deck plane. Passengers could reach the upper deck through a winding staircase. Originally, this area was only for first class travellers - today it is used as an additional passenger area. The upper deck was also where the cockpit was. Pilots had to get used to this perspective from which they took off and landed the new plane. The engines of the new plane were gigantic and in the early days there were problems with overheating. Airports also had to adapt to the gigantic Boeing. Runways had to be extended, taxiways made wider. Airlines at first were doubtful if they could fill up the new jumbo with enough passengers in order to make money with the new plane. In fact, the 747 was too big at the beginning. The oil crisis of the 1970s brought a crisis to the airlines and fewer passengers. But as time went on, the new fleets attracted more and more customers and were bought by airlines around the globe. Since its birth in 1969 the 747 has succeeded in bringing airline travel to more and more people and it has made travelling cheaper. The operating costs of a jumbo carrying 400 passengers are less than those of two airplanes with 200 passengers each. The 747 is a true success story and may well stay on for years to come.",
        "Topic77":"The medical term for a broken bone is a fracture. But there are different kinds of fractures. A single fracture is when a bone is broken in just one place. You may have heard the term hairline fracture. This is a single fracture that is very small, like the width of a hair. A complete fracture is when the bone comes apart. Sometimes bones get broken in more than one place. Still another condition is called a bowing fracture. This happens with a bone that bends but does not break. It happens mostly in children. Ever heard of a greenstick fracture? This is when a bone is bent and breaks along only one side, like a young stick of wood. Another kind of break is an open or compound fracture. This is when the bone breaks the skin. This is very serious. Along with the bone damage there is a risk of infection in the open wound. A lot of things happen as the body reacts to an injury like a broken bone. You might suddenly feel sick to your stomach. People who are seriously injured can go into shock. They might feel cold, dizzy and unable to think clearly. Shock needs medical attention at once. Breaking a Bone but while broken bones can be painful, they are normally not life-threatening. Still, broken bones should be treated quickly because they can stop blood flow or cause nerve damage. Also, the break will start to repair itself, so you want to make sure that the bone is in its right place. X-rays are taken to see the break. If a bone is broken a doctor sets it into its correct position. Severe breaks may have to be operated on. Metal plates and screws sometimes hold the bone together. Then, a hard cast may be put around the area of the break to hold the bone in place while it heals. Casts are usually worn for one to two months. In some cases, instead of a cast, a splint made of plastic or metal will be fastened over the area so that you can't move it more than you should. Bones need calcium and vitamin D to grow and reach their full strength. Keeping bones strong with exercise may also help prevent fractures, especially if you wear the right sports protection during activities.",
        "Topic78":"There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services. So she made shift to get on, and always looked as spry and cheery as if she had not a want in the world. Now one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch! ‘Goodness me!’ she cried, ‘That would be just the very thing for me if I only had something to put in it! But I haven't! Now who could have left it in the ditch?’ And she looked about her expecting the owner would not be far off; but she could see nobody. ‘Maybe there is a hole in it,’ she went on, ‘and that's why it has been cast away. But it would do fine to put a flower in for my window; so I'll just take it home with me.’ And with that she lifted the lid and looked inside. ‘Mercy me!’ she cried, fair amazed. ‘If it isn't full of gold pieces. Here's luck!’ And so it was, brim-full of great gold coins. Well, at first she simply stood stock-still, wondering if she was standing on her head or her heels. Then she began saying: ‘Lawks! But I do feel rich. I feel awful rich!’ After she had said this many times, she began to wonder how she was to get her treasure home. It was too heavy for her to carry, and she could see no better way than to tie the end of her shawl to it and drag it behind her like a go-cart. ‘It will soon be dark,’ she said to herself as she trotted along. ‘So much the better’ The neighbours will not see what I'm bringing home, and I shall have all the night to myself, and be able to think what I'll do! Mayhap I'll buy a grand house and just sit by the fire with a cup o' tea and do no work at all like a queen. Or maybe I'll bury it at the garden foot and just keep a bit in the old china teapot on the chimney-piece. Or maybe-Goody! Goody! I feel that grand I don't know myself.’ By this time she was a bit tired of dragging such a heavy weight, and, stopping to rest a while, turned to look at her treasure. And lo! it wasn't a pot of gold at all! It was nothing but a lump of silver. She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes, and stared at it again. ‘Well! I never!’ she said at last. ‘And me thinking it was a pot of gold! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! Silver is far less trouble-easier to mind, and not so easy stolen. The gold pieces would have been the death o' me, and with this great lump of silver-’So she went off again planning what she would do, and feeling as rich as rich, until becoming a bit tired again she stopped to rest and gave a look round to see if her treasure was safe; and she saw nothing but a great lump of iron!",
        "Topic79":"The Braille system was created in 1821 by a Frenchman, Louis Braille. It is a method widely used by blind people to read and write. Each letter or number in Braille is made up of a cell that has six up to raised dots in two rows of three dots each, which means 64 possible combinations. Blind people read Braille by moving their fingers over these cells and feeling the letters and numbers. Louis Braille became blind himself at the age of three. He developed the system in order to improve the books he used at school. He changed a code he got from a soldier and made it simple so that everyone could learn it. The creation of Braille opened the door to blind people all over the world. Today different Braille codes are used to show letters in different languages. Sets of codes are also used for mathematics and music. Braille cell code In Braille, a cell dot pattern gives you the letter to read. The dot height is about 0.5 mm; the space between dots is about 2.5 mm. A standard page in Braille has about 40-43 cells per line and about 25 lines. Larger cells are often used by those who have problems feeling the normal Braille cells. Most languages have two grades of Braille. Grade one is used by beginners. Each letter of the word is spelled out. Grade two Braille is an advanced form. It makes reading and writing quicker because it has special codes for words or groups of letters that are often used in that language. Almost all books use this grade because it saves space and makes reading quicker. When writing in Braille you need a slate and a stylus in which each dot is created writing from right to left at the back of the page. There are also special Braille keyboards that you can attach to a computer. Although Braille is thought to be the main way that blind people can read and write, only few people really use it. In Great Britain, for example only about 20,000 out of 2 million visually impaired actually use Braille. Younger people tend to use electronic text on computers instead. A debate has started on how to make Braille more attractive to users.",
        "Topic80":"When air travel started in the 20th century it was very expensive. Only the rich people could afford travelling by plane. As time went on better planes were built. They were faster, quieter and could carry more people over longer distances. Flying was slowly becoming a means of transportation that normal people could afford. Into the 60s and 70s many airlines kept selling expensive tickets to their passengers. They offered a comfortable way of travelling which included free meals, friendly service and other luxuries. In the 1980s a new type of airline emerged. Budget airlines offered tickets that were much cheaper than those of other carriers. They manage this by cutting costs wherever they can. Running an airline is an expensive business. The biggest cost is the plane itself. Average passenger jets cost around $50 million to $100 million, larger planes can cost up to $300 million and more. Pilots cost a lot of money too. A pilot with ten years of experience may get a salary of $100,000 and more. Fuel costs cannot be calculated so easily because they change a lot depending on whether or not oil prices are up or down. Many other factors raise the costs of operating an airplane, for example the number of seats that are empty. If you don't sell all of the tickets the airline is not making the best possible profit. One of the ways that airlines can reduce their costs is by buying fuel at the right time. If they buy kerosene when it is cheap they may be able to save millions of dollars. Another way of cutting expenses is to use only one kind of airplane. This saves money on maintenance, repairs and training pilots. Many budget airlines chose smaller airports to take off and land. A big airport like New York JFK or London Heathrow charges airlines higher fees. Low cost carriers like Ryan Air choose to take their passengers to London Stansted instead of Heathrow. In some cases airlines choose airports that lie between two bigger cities. Airlines do many other things to cut costs. Many offer only one class of seats. They don't have a business class. Some of them do not reserve seats, so passengers can sit wherever they want. They also save on the number of crew members. A lot of money can be saved by selling tickets on their own website instead of through a travel agent. Many airlines try to stay on the ground as little as possible. After landing, the plane is refueled and takes off a short time later. Many budget airlines only offer the real flight. You have to pay for onboard food and drinks. Recently Ryan Air has thought about even charging a toilet fee for its passengers.",

Modern bullfighting goes back to the 1700s when the first bullrings were built in Spain. A bullfight takes place in bullring. The matador, or bullfighter, has special training and is often a national hero in his homeland. The bulls used for bullfighting are very powerful, wild animals that are bred to attack. They weigh up to 500 kg or even more. Today many animal activists are against bullfighting because bulls are treated in a cruel way and have to suffer pain in the arena. Bullfights can also end with a matador's death or injury if he is pierced by a bull's horns. A bullfight usually consists of six fights. Three matadors with their teams fight two bulls each. A bullfight has three acts. After the trumpets sound at the beginning, the bull is let into the ring. The bullfighter waves a colourful cape at the bull and tries to make it attack. During this part he studies the movements of the bull. A picador enters the arena on horseback. He makes the bull weaker by piercing his neck with sharp spikes. In the second act, the assistants of the matador, called banderilleros, come into the ring on foot, run around and throw barbed darts into the animal's neck to make it even madder. In the final act the bullfighter is in the ring alone with the bull. He uses a small cape, waves at the bull and lures it into attacking him. He tries to be as close to the bull as possible. Finally, he thrusts his sword into the bull's neck and kills it. If he succeeds in pushing the sword into the bull's shoulder blades it dies at once. After the successful performance of the matador the spectators get up and applaud. The bullfighter gets one or maybe even two of the bull's ears as a reward.",

His father, Gaius Caesar died when Caesar was 16. Caesar's mother, Aurelia, influenced her son greatly. Although Caesar came from a noble upper class family, he supported the normal people. Caesar studied public speaking on Rhodes, an island in the Mediterranean Sea. On his way there, he was captured by pirates who wanted gold from him. Caesar quickly organized a small navy, captured the pirates and had them killed. After Caesar returned from Rhodes, he began his political career. In 69 or 68 BC he became quester, a high Roman officer, who controlled finances. Caesar soon moved up the Roman political ladder. He organized great games that made him popular with the public. In order to make him stronger Caesar made a political agreement with the two most powerful men in Rome, the rich Marcus Licinius Crassus and the popular general Pompey the Great. This partnership became known as the First Triumvirate. In 59 BC Caesar was elected consul, the highest public office in old Rome. As one of two consuls, he ruled the Roman state for one year. After his year of office Caesar left Rome to govern Gaul, a province that is now France. There he worked and fought together with his soldiers. He fought against and conquered many tribes of Western Europe and became a great soldier. Meanwhile, Caesar's old friend Crassus was killed while fighting in Asia. Caesar and his other old friend, Pompey, then became rivals. They fought for power. Pompey wanted Caesar to give up his power but Caesar was unwilling to do that. He marched back from Gaul toward Italy at the head of his army. The Romans sided with Caesar, so Pompey fled across the sea to Greece. Caesar took over the treasury in Rome and set up a government with himself as dictator. For five years Caesar's soldiers fought against Pompey's supporters. Caesar followed Pompey to Egypt, but Pompey was murdered before Caesar could catch him. To prove his power, Caesar continued to fight and win battles. After one victory in Asia, he sent back the message, ‘Veni, vidi, vici,’ which means ‘I came, I saw, I conquered.’ When Caesar returned to Rome he became the permanent head of the government and became even more honoured and powerful. Romans created statues of him and compared him to god. Caesar also had many enemies. Some of them thought that power should not be in the hand of one person. On March 15, 44 BC, 60 senators organized the murder of Caesar at a meeting of the Senate. Caesar's friend Brutus was head of the conspiracy. Caesar first fought back but then Brutus killed him with his dagger. . Rome's greatest statesman and soldier left the world many things. Caesar founded the Julian calendar, which is now used in most parts of the world. The Roman month Quintilis, in which Caesar was born, was renamed July in his honour.",
        "Topic83":"You are drinking lots of cola at a party, when it suddenly hits. You are full of energy, you jump around, and you talk too fast. Later you can't fall asleep and the next day you're tired and feel awful. Does that sound familiar? Most children already have a lot of energy, but kids who drink a lot of cola often end up even more wired than usual. The drink includes a lot of sugar but also a chemical that produces a lot of energy - caffeine. Like cola, coffee is full of caffeine. That's why many adults drink it the first thing in the morning to help them wake up. The chemical is naturally found in tea, chocolate and hot cocoa. Because many people need this kick, food producers often add it to many other beverages, energy drinks and snacks. But is caffeine good or bad for us? Some studies have shown that caffeine might help people respond to things more quickly. Scientists have found out that caffeinated coffee and tea can help protect your heart, brain and other organs from disease. On the other hand too much caffeine can make people anxious and unable to sleep. This is worrisome because we need sleep to stay healthy. Caffeine may also raise your blood pressure, increase your heart rate and make you feel more stressed. Love it or hate it, caffeine is hard to avoid. Coffee shops are all over the place, in city streets and malls. Machines offer coffee and cola at schools. Even though you can get caffeine-free coffee, tea and cola almost everywhere more than 80% of adults in America consume caffeine regularly. Caffeine raises the amount of sugar in your bloodstream, even if there is no sugar in your caffeinated drink. That's what gives you extra energy. Taking caffeine away from regular users causes withdrawal symptoms, like headaches and sleepiness. It also makes them react more slowly. So when you give these people the caffeine that they need they do better and react more quickly. Many athletes take caffeine to boost their energy. Studies show however that caffeine only helps those athletes who are in good condition already. In an experiment runners had to run at a very fast pace. On average they were able to run for about 32 minutes. After taking caffeine they ran 7 to 10 minutes longer. Although caffeine may be good for world class athletes, it may harm the health of people who are overweight.",
        "Topic84":"Camping is a very popular form of living outdoors. It gives people the opportunity of spending their free time in nature or in the wilderness. Camping may start by spending the night in a tent in your own back yard and end up by going on a trip that may last for several weeks. Some campers stay in one place for days, a week or even longer. From there they visit tourist attractions, go fishing or hunting, play games and do active sports like mountain biking or just simply relax. Others prefer to tour areas and spend every night in a different place. They travel by car or motor homes. Each year millions of people go camping. They can explore new surroundings and be close to nature at the same time. Most people drive to a campsite and set up a tent there. This is easy because you can take everything you need for your camping holiday in your car with you. In most cases you will choose a campsite that is near the road. Travelling in recreational vehicles (RV) is more comfortable but also much more expensive. These RVs range from small trailers to large mobile homes. They have all the luxuries that you would also have at home, like refrigerators, showers sinks or toilets. Boat campers travel with a canoe, kayak or even a small houseboat. They spend days on lakes or rivers and usually camp on the water's edge nearly every night. In Western Europe, especially Holland, Belgium or Ireland you can rent a boat and travel on one of the hundreds of canals and smaller rivers that crisscross these countries. CampingBackpackers are hikers who carry their belongings on their backs. They usually go to places that you cannot reach by car. Special equipment is usually extremely light and can be carried on longer trips. Campers who travel by bike usually can stay at normal campsites. On one side cyclists can get to places that you can't get to by car and on the other side they travel longer distances than hikers do. They pack their things in waterproof saddlebags which they strap to the frame of the bike. Organized camping holidays usually take place during the summer and are attended by girls and boys. They combine outdoor activities with other kinds of training or with learning. Boy and girl scouts are groups of children who go on special camping trips. If you go camping and want to spend the night in a tent you will need certain items. Today's tents are normally made of nylon, canvas or other light material. They are not so expensive and easy to fold together and carry around with you, especially if you are backpacking. The material has to be waterproof and is easy to put up If you want to sleep in a tent you will need a sleeping bag. It protects you from the outside cold and is warmer than a blanket. Sleeping bags come in different sizes, colours and shapes. Sleeping on the ground however is not always very comfortable. Some campers have foam pads or air mattresses which they lie on. Clothing is an important aspect when you go on a camping holiday. Be sure to take clothes with you that will protect you from the sun, rain and insects. Take along some lightweight trousers, comfortable shoes and warm shirts or a jacket for cold evenings. Always carry a raincoat or poncho with you. Hiking boots are good if you walk a lot. You will also need other everyday items such as a toothbrush, toothpaste and soap. Take along sunglasses, maps, and a compass or maybe even a GPS device. Campers should also have waterproof matches, extra batteries, a knife and a lantern or torch with them.",
        "Topic85":"Capitalism is an economic system in which private people, not the government, own and run companies. These companies compete with other companies for business. They decide what products they want to produce, how much they should cost and where to sell them. Companies do all these things in order to make profits for their owners. People who use their money to start companies or run companies are called capitalists. Even though a pure form of capitalism does not exist and governments control the economy in some ways it remains the world's most popular economic system. In the United States the government keeps itself out of the economy as far as possible but in some European countries economic control is much larger. Other names for capitalism are free-market economy or free enterprise. In a capitalist system private households need goods. They buy these goods from the income that they have. Some households have more income than others. Sometimes only one member of a household has a job, at other times both husband and wife go to work. Then they have more money to buy goods. This is the demand side of the economy. On the other side companies and businesses offer private households goods and services. They produce the goods that they think consumers will want to buy. To do this they need workers to produce these goods and services. This is the supply side of the economy. Companies and households get together at markets. Here they exchange goods, services and jobs (labour). A market is a place where people buy and sell things. In a capitalist society the prices of goods, services and labour are determined by supply and demand. If a lot of people want to buy a certain product its price will go up. Products that are mass produced usually have low prices. Another important feature of capitalism is competition. Many companies may sell the same type of product. Companies will try to sell better products at a cheaper price so that they can get consumers to buy their products. Firms that cannot compete are very often driven out of business. The same can be said about wages. In some cases businesses have to pay workers more money to get them to work. In other cases low paid work often exists in areas where there are more workers than are needed. In today's world governments get involved in the economy in certain ways and leaders must often make economic decisions. A government must make sure that there is enough competition to keep prices low the quality products high. If only a few companies produce products they may agree to keep prices high. In a monopoly, only one company produces goods and services that everybody needs, so it can set the price. In the second half of the 19th century companies started to get bigger and bigger by taking over smaller ones. Soon these so-called trusts had a lot of power and controlled the market and the prices. At the beginning of the 20th century the United States passed a law which helped smaller companies survive. Business leaders often do not care about what their decisions may do to our society. For example, a factory may pollute a river by pouring dirty water into it. It is the job of government organizations to make sure that this does not happen. The state of economy is not the same all the time. Normally, there are always ups and downs. Sometimes the economy of a country is in good condition, everybody has enough money and lots of goods are produced. On the other side there may be years in which there are a lot of unemployed people and factories cannot sell their products. The business cycle shows the economy in four phases.",
        "Topic86":"Cars are automobiles that can transport people. It is the main means of travelling for hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Cars have changed the way we live probably more than any other invention in history. At first only a few people had cars but after a while more and more people bought them because they improved the way people lived. Farmers with cars were able to bring their products to places that were farther away. The appearance of cities and towns also changed. More and more workers drove to their jobs and people started to move to suburbs outside the town centres. Automobiles give people many jobs. Millions of people around the world work in factories where cars are produced. Millions more work at gas stations, restaurants or motels that travellers stop at. However, cars also cause problems. Millions of people die in car accidents every year. Automobiles pollute the air that we breathe and parking space in cities is scarce because everyone wants to use their cars to get to city centres. Cars are very complicated machines and all systems in them work together. The power a car, control and steer it and make it comfortable for people to drive in. The heart of every car is its engine. It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems. Most automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels. The fuel system pumps petrol from the tank to the engine. Older cars used to have carburettors that mix fuel with air and send the gas to the engine. Some cars have a special fuel injection system that sprays petrol into the engine. Modern cars have turbo chargers that suck in extra air and therefore create more power. The engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive. The transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions. In cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears. The driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads. The differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft. It lets the wheels turn at different speeds because in curves the outer wheels must travel a greater distance than the inner ones. Steering system of an automobile Steering system The steering system controls the front wheels. Turning the steering wheel makes them point to the left or right. Most cars have power steering; a hydraulic system makes it easier for the driver to turn the wheels.",
        "Topic87":"A cathedral is a big church that is usually under the control of a bishop. It is usually the seat of a diocese, a church district headed by a bishop. Most cathedrals, especially medieval ones, are located in the centre of a town or city. They served as the centre of public life. Markets, meetings and masses were held there. Most cathedrals are built in the shape of a cross. The main entrance is at the west end at the bottom of the cross. There is a long central aisle called the nave and two side aisles. The arms of the cross are the transepts and meet the nave at the crossing. Towers and domes were often built over the crossing. The altar and the seats for the choir are at the eastern end of the nave in front of the apse, which looks like a semi-circle. Cathedrals have been built in almost every architectural style. But most of the famous European cathedrals were Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic or Renaissance. The greatest era of building happened in Europe between 1000 and 1500 A.D. Cathedrals were filled with carved sculptures .The walls had paintings and the windows were painted with scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. In the first centuries A.D. the centre of Christianity was around the city of Byzantinium, which was later called Constantinople and is now Istanbul. Architecture in the Byzantine Empire was a combination of styles that came from the Middle East and ancient Rome. Hagia Sophia was one of the first Byzantine cathedrals. As time went on the centre of Christianity moved to Europe. Rome had become completely Christian other countries to the north also converted to Christianity. The new style came up at around 1000 A.D. Northern art began to influence traditional Roman art. By the 1100s people the Germanic peoples from the North-Germans, Goths and Franks-dominated European Christianity. Their cathedrals were very tall as if they wanted to reach to heaven. Most of Europe's famous Cathedrals are built in Gothic style but every region had its own style. In the 1300s a new spirit began to grow in Italy. People were curious about new things and made new discoveries. The period was called Renaissance, which means rebirth. It was a time when the population wanted to know and learn things about classical Greece and Rome. Renaissance architects looked back to the buildings and structures of ancient Rome and Greece. They mixed features of old and new architecture. St. Peter's cathedral in Rome is one of the best examples of a Renaissance cathedral. The dome was designed by Michelangelo. Many cathedrals of Western Europe are famous for their great beauty. France is the home of some of the most beautiful cathedrals. St. Paul's Cathedral in London and Canterbury Cathedral are England's biggest churches. Other famous cathedrals in Europe are in Cologne, Milan and Seville.",
        "Topic88":"By the end of the 15th century many things were changing in Europe. The population started to grow more quickly and a new class of merchants emerged. They wanted to buy and sell expensive and valuable products from Asia like gold, jewels and silk. In those days, people had no refrigerators to preserve their food. They dried meat and often used salt to make it last longer. To make food taste better they used spices, like pepper or cinnamon. For centuries Europeans brought these goods on a land route from Asia over thousands of dangerous kilometres. In the 15th century the overland routes were being controlled by the Turkish Empire, which made it even more difficult for European merchants to pass through. As a result, some European countries, like Spain and Portugal, decided to find out if there was a sea route to India. With the help of new kinds of ships that could sail faster and instruments, like the quadrant, they started the Age of Exploration. Vasco da Gama's route around Africa at the end of the 15th century the Portuguese started to explore the west coast of Africa. They set up trading posts and collected gold and silver. They were convinced that by sailing around the coast of Africa they would find a route to India. In 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartholomeu Dias sailed around the southern part of the continent and got as far as the east coast of Africa, but a storm made him turn back. On his return voyage, he saw a piece of land that stretched out into the sea. The Portuguese named it the Cape of Good Hope because they were hopeful of finding a passageway to India. In 1497 Vasco Da Gama set out from Lisbon, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and into the Indian Ocean. He reached the west coast of India in May 1498. He took some spices and gold back with him to prove that he had reached India. Christopher Columbus was probably the most famous explorer of the era. He achieved fame by sailing west in search of a sea route to India. Instead of reaching India he discovered that there was an unknown mass of land in between, land that the Europeans knew nothing of. Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy in 1451 and during his early years his father took him on various sailing trips and wanted to make a merchant out of him. Like many navigators of that time, Columbus also wanted to sail to India and the Far East. He thought that if he sailed west he would also reach the Spice Islands of Asia and India. When he went to the king of Portugal to present his plan, but it was rejected. Queen Isabella of Spain admired young and brave men like Columbus and so she gave him three ships ‘the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria’ and a crew of 90 men. Columbus left Spain on August 3, 1492. After two months of sailing westward, he landed on an island of the Bahamas, San Salvador, on October 12, 1492. Because he thought he had reached the islands near India he called the natives Indians. Altogether, Columbus made four voyages to the New World between 1492 and 1504. He explored the coasts of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. On his last two voyages, Columbus reached the mainland of Central and South America and travelled as far south as the mouth of the Orinoco River. After he came home from his fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus fell ill and died in 1506.",
        "Topic89":"Amphibians are animals that live on land and in water. They were the ancestors of today's reptiles and mammals and the first vertebrates to appear on land, about 350 million years ago. Over 4000 types of amphibians live in almost all regions of the world, especially in hot and humid areas. Among the most popular amphibians are frogs and salamanders. Amphibians can grow to different sizes, smaller ones are only 1 cm in length and larger ones can reach up to one and a half metres. Those that live mostly on land breathe through their lungs, others, which live mainly in water have gills. An amphibian's skin is wet and often covered with a sticky fluid that prevents it from becoming dry. Some species lose their outer skin layer several times a year. Others produce poison that protects them from enemies. Many amphibians are colourful animals that blend in with their surroundings. Some amphibians, for example frogs have thick bodies and four powerful legs that they use to leap and swim. Toads have shorter legs than frogs and a drier skin. They have no tail. Salamanders are amphibians with a short body and a long tail, which they can grow if they lose them. These creatures, which are found mostly in temperate climate zones, live near rivers and under rocks. Caecilians look a lot like worms. They have long thin bodies without legs. These tropical amphibians are nearly blind because their eyes are covered with skin or bone. Only few of them live in water. Amphibians are cold blooded animals. Their body temperature is about the same as their surroundings. Most animals move to other places to adjust their body temperature if it gets too hot or too cold. Depending on the climate, amphibians hibernate or are inactive during the year when it gets too hot or cold. They eat many different kinds of food including insects and worms. Most amphibians lay their eggs in the water. Young animals have fish-like features. After living as a larva they grow gills which allow them to breathe under water. During a phase called metamorphosis a young amphibian develops from a larva into an adult. This stage can take from a few weeks to several years. Some amphibians then lose their gills and develop lungs for breathing. Often they also change their appearance. ",
        "Topic90":"An amusement park is an outdoor area with games, rides and shows. They are spread over a large area, often many square kilometres. Young and old visitors can enjoy many types of attractions. They can ride on roller coasters, go high up in the air in a Ferris wheel or ride on carousels. Amusement parks also offer restaurants and bars to eat and drink, as well as green areas with grass to sit down or relax. Most amusement parks have a fixed location. Some of them are open all year round, others only during the warmer season. Today amusement parks have been replaced by theme parks. These places focus on a certain topic of history or natural life. The first theme park, Disneyland, opened in California in 1955. In the middle Ages minstrels wandered around and sang in open areas. Entertainers gathered in a town field or a market square. After a few days they went to another town. They often performed in tents and offered food and entertainment. In addition, visitors could see circus artists perform or have their portrait painted by street painters. The first real amusement parks emerged out of fairs and public gardens in Europe in the 16th century. Later on amusement parks in fixed locations developed in larger cities. The Prater in Vienna was the basis for many amusement parks in other locations. The first amusement park in the United States was located on Coney Island, in New York City. For a long time it was the world's biggest attraction, with bars, souvenir shops, rides along a long beach. After its peak in the 1920s, the amusement area's popularity declined. After World War II larger-scale amusement parks started developing in Europe and other continents. Up to the end of the twentieth century European parks are small compared to their American counterparts. The first large amusement park outside the USA was Euro Disneyland, which opened in Paris in 1990. In Japan an Asian version of Disneyland opened in 1993.In Denmark, Legoland features miniature buildings and attractions built out of the world-famous Lego plastic bricks. Rides are the greatest attractions of amusement parks. By the 19th century many entertainment parks had carousels or merry-go-rounds. They began to become popular during medieval tournaments where knights fought against each other. Later on roller coasters were added to the attractions of amusement parks. They featured steep drops from high altitudes. Roller coasters originated from Russian ice slides that were built for the people as early as the 17th century. Today almost every amusement park has a Ferris wheel. The first original Ferris wheel in the United States was built for the Chicago Exhibition in 1893. It allowed visitors to rise to about 80 meters. Today Ferris wheels are not only located in amusement parks but in other places as well. London Eye, for example, is situated on the Thames River and gives visitors a breath-taking view of London.",
        "Topic91":"Many mammals, birds, fish, insects and other animals travel regularly from one place to another during a certain time of the year. This journey is called migration. Animals change their living areas because they may get more food, better places to build nests or more sunlight somewhere else. Some animals travel thousands of kilometres across land and water. Others travel only short distances. Water animals, for example, often move vertically from deeper water to the surface area. Birds are animals that travel the greatest distances. Many types of birds migrate each year between their breeding grounds in the northern part of the world and warmer regions near the equator where they spend their summer months. In tropical regions birds often travel from wet to dry areas. The Arctic tern spends the summer in the Arctic regions and then flies half way around the world to the Antarctic for the winter. When flying, most birds follow geographical features, like mountains, rivers or islands. A few types of butterflies are also long-distance travellers. The monarch butterfly, for instance, spends most of the winter in Mexico and then travels back to the United States in the spring. Mammals do not migrate so much because walking is slow and takes up too much time. There are, however, hoofed animals that do travel longer distances in order to search for better grazing places. Reindeer or caribou can move long distances between their winter and summer homes. They migrate in herds of up to 100,000 animals. Caribou spend the summer in the Canadian Arctic and then travel up to one thousand kilometres to the forests along the American border. Zebras and other wild animals that live in the Serengeti area migrate every year in search of new pastures and food. During annual rainfall they spread out and during the dry season they gather together around waterholes. Some sea mammals also migrate. Whales travel from colder Polar Regions to warmer water where they mate and bring up their babies. Then they travel back to the colder waters, where there is more food. Seals often do the same. Although most reptiles do not migrate so much there are some that follow a yearly cycles. Sea turtles spend most of their life at sea but each year they come to the coasts and lay their eggs in nests on the beach. The most famous breeding place is Ascension Island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Turtles come from the coast of Brazil over a distance of 2000 km and make their nests there. The best known migratory fish is the salmon. It is born in freshwater rivers and then swims to sea. There it finds a lot of food an grows very quickly Salmon can spend one to three years in ocean waters and then swim back to the rivers where they hatched to lay their own eggs. Most of them find their way back home because of the smell of the water in which they were born.",
        "Topic92":"Archaeology is the study of buildings and objects that people made a long time ago. Archaeologists take a look at how people lived before writing was invented. They examine their daily life and what they left behind. They also try to find out why cultures and civilizations fell apart or why people of the time hunted certain animals. Because history is such a vast field, archaeologists mostly concentrate on certain periods of history, for example ancient Greece, or ancient Egypt. An archaeologist has many different tasks to do. Besides fieldwork they excavate objects and try to reconstruct historical sites. They also examine their findings and try to learn more about a certain period in history. Fieldwork is the discovery of sites that are worth studying. Sometimes archaeologists know where to look for, however, at other times they make such discoveries by chance. Some objects are close to the surface and can be found easily while others can only be traced with the help of satellite images or other advanced methods. For archaeological sites under the earth's surface or under water they use sound technology and radar. After fieldwork is completed an archaeologist starts to excavate the site. They use various instruments like shovels and picks, but must be careful not to damage or destroy valuable objects and findings. Architects use special brushes to scrap away soil and set objects free. The objects they discover are called artefacts. They are labelled and often covered with chemicals so that they can be preserved. Sometimes field laboratories are set up in order to catalogue the objects that are found. When finished with digging out ancient objects archaeologists must interpret what they have found. They try to determine how old artefacts are and from which period they come. Sometimes scientists from other fields help with their work. An archaeologist can date an object by comparing it with the other objects that have been nearby. Artefacts are compared with rock layers in order to figure out their approximate age. Other methods use the rings of the trees, which prove to be highly accurate. Radiocarbon dating is the most accurate method of finding out how old something is. Every living object has traces of radioactive carbon in them. The amount of carbon decreases after a living thing dies. Archaeologists can compare the carbon in artefacts to living objects and calculate their age. This method is very accurate for objects that go back thousands of years. Archaeology first emerged during the Renaissance period of the 1400s. At that time many people were curious about older things. They found pleasure in the classics and were anxious to find out how the ancient Greeks and Romans lived. In the 18th century excavations began in Italy. During that time the historic sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum were set free. Scientists found streets, baths houses as well as paintings and statues from the old Roman towns. In the 1870s Troy and other sites on Greek islands were excavated. The most exciting finding of modern archaeology occurred in 1922 when the British archaeologist Howard Carter found the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen in the Valley of the Kings. Inside the tomb was a mummy in a gold coffin which was virtually untouched. Later on other parts of the world became the centre of archaeological interest. In 1940, caves with prehistoric wall painting were found in southern France. Other important sites include the Aztec civilisation in Mexico and the Terracotta Army of ancient China. Today most archaeologists work at universities or government departments, which also provide funds for their work. Sometimes they get money from museums or private organisations.",
        "Topic93":"Between 1910 and 1970 the Australian government took 100,000 Aboriginal children away from their homes. These children, known as the Stolen Generation, were often under five years of age. They were taken away from their families because the government did not believe in the future of the Aborigines. They thought it would be better to bring them to white families. Many methods were used to separate Aboriginal babies and children from their families. Children were simply taken away by government officials and later told that they were orphans. Mothers often were given documents to sign. They could not read or write and they were told it was some kind of vaccination program. Others were taken to hospitals and never seen by their families again. In most cases rich white families were given money to bring them up. Some went to orphanages or church missions. In 1995 an investigation was stated to bring more truth to the topic. The government however did not apologize to the victims. The new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was the first Australian politician to make a formal apology to the Aborigines in 2008. However, he also said that the government would not give any money to the victims. He claimed that it was in the interests of government to raise the children in the best way. Up to now only one member of Australia's Stolen Generation has received money from the government. Bruce Trevor-row was taken to hospital on Christmas Day in 1957. His father never saw him again and the government sent him to a white foster family. He came back to his mother when he was ten years old. In his further life he suffered from depression and turned to alcohol. In 1998 he went to court and succeeded in getting about 500,000 dollars from the Australian government as a form of compensation. There are many others in Australia who have suffered the same fate. Organizations are being set up to work for the rights of the Aborigines and to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.",
        "Topic94":"The medical term for a broken bone is a fracture. But there are different kinds of fractures. A single fracture is when a bone is broken in just one place. You may have heard the term hairline fracture. This is a single fracture that is very small, like the width of a hair. A complete fracture is when the bone comes apart. Sometimes bones get broken in more than one place. Still another condition is called a bowing fracture. This happens with a bone that bends but does not break. It happens mostly in children. Ever heard of a green-stick fracture? This is when a bone is bent and breaks along only one side, like a young stick of wood. Another kind of break is an open or compound fracture. This is when the bone breaks the skin. This is very serious. Along with the bone damage there is a risk of infection in the open wound. A lot of things happen as the body reacts to an injury like a broken bone. You might suddenly feel sick to your stomach. People who are seriously injured can go into shock. They might feel cold, dizzy and unable to think clearly. Shock needs medical attention at once. Breaking a Bone but while broken bones can be painful, they are normally not life-threatening. Still, broken bones should be treated quickly because they can stop blood flow or cause nerve damage. Also, the break will start to repair itself, so you want to make sure that the bone is in its right place. X-rays are taken to see the break. If a bone is broken a doctor sets it into its correct position. Severe breaks may have to be operated on. Metal plates and screws sometimes hold the bone together. Then, a hard cast may be put around the area of the break to hold the bone in place while it heals. Casts are usually worn for one to two months. In some cases, instead of a cast, a splint made of plastic or metal will be fastened over the area so that you can't move it more than you should. Bones need calcium and vitamin D to grow and reach their full strength. Keeping bones strong with exercise may also help prevent fractures, especially if you wear the right sports protection during activities.",
        "Topic95":"An avalanche is a large mass of snow that moves quickly down a mountain. It breaks loose from the area around it and collects more and more snow as it pushes downward. Avalanches occur in mountainous regions, for example the Alps, Himalayas or the Rocky Mountains. They can reach speeds of over 100 km an hour and destroy forests and villages that are in their way. They can block roads and train tracks and make areas unreachable from the outside. Avalanches kill over a hundred people in Europe and North America every year, burying them below tons of snow. Although the danger of avalanches is high throughout the winter months there are weather and snow conditions in which avalanches occur more often. The composition of snow is an important factor. Once the snow is on the ground temperature changes its structure so that different layer of snow can form on the slope. Avalanches occur on slopes that have an angle of 30 to 60 degrees. On slopes that are not so steep there is not enough gravity to let the snow break off from its surroundings. On steeper slopes the snow usually breaks off more quickly. Avalanches can be triggered by many factors. In some cases an increasing amount of new snow can start an avalanche. Strong winds can transport snow to the leeward side of the mountain. There, the snow stays soft and does not bind with other layers. In other cases, skiers, snowboarders or other alpine tourists can trigger an avalanche. As snow falls it builds up layer upon layer. After a certain time the layers harden and bond with one another. If they don't the snow profile becomes unstable and soft layers can slide on top of harder ones. The starting point is where snow breaks off and begins to slide. It is mostly in higher regions of a slope. The track of an avalanche is the path that it follows downhill, which can be hundreds of metres long. As the avalanche moves towards the valley it gathers more and more snow. The runout zone is where the avalanche slows down and finally comes to a stop. Powder snow avalanches occur when more and more powder snow accumulates and starts moving like a cloud in the sky at speeds of up to 400 km an hour. Wet snow avalanches are triggered when snow starts becoming warmer and wetter. These avalanches spread sideways as they move downhill. Snow hardens so that buried victims hardly have a chance of breathing. Slab avalanches are the most common. They occur when layers of snow don't cling together so that skiers or snowboarders trigger the top layer which slides down on the other harder ones. In areas where avalanches are likely to occur, people have taken action to protect themselves and their surroundings. Avalanches can be set off on purpose through explosions. In some places rakes are set up on slopes to slow down and split up the moving snow. Trees, fences, rocks or concrete barriers can also to slow down moving avalanches. Most alpine countries have avalanche warning systems that tell tourists when and where it is dangerous to move around in the mountains. In most countries the danger of avalanches is displayed on a risk scale ranging from one to five. One is a low risk situation with stable snow conditions while five displays a very high risk of avalanches with unstable snow conditions.",

He was seen as a creative figure in pop music, which often reinvented his sound and changed his musical style. Bowie was born as David Jones in the southern part of London on January 8, 1947. He started playing saxophone at an early age and joined up with many bands during high school. Later on he changed his name to Bowie in order to avoid being mixed up with the lead singer of the Monkees, Davy Jones. Space Oddity was his first hit. It was written at the time of the first moon landing and introduced Major Tom, a fictional astronaut. In his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Bowie describes the ups and downs of a rock star. Other hit records include Let's Dance, Fame and Without You. In the 1970s, David Bowie started an acting career and appeared in several movies. He was admired for his performance in the Broadway play Elephant Man. Towards the end of the 1990s, Bowie slowly stepped out of spotlight. In 2004, he stopped giving concerts. In the last 15 years, David Bowie's health deteriorated. He suffered a series of heart attacks and was diagnosed with cancer. Bowie died on January 10, 2016, shortly after the release of his latest album Black-star, which shot to the top position in the UK and US charts. In his last video, Bowie shows himself to his audience in a hospital bed with his eyes bandaged.

My father made holes in these so that I could string them, and for a long time they kept me happy and contented. The conductor, too, was kind. Often when he went his rounds I clung to his coat tails while he collected and punched the tickets. His punch, with which he let me play, was a delightful toy. Curled up in a corner of the seat I amused myself for hours making funny little holes in bits of cardboard. My aunt made me a big doll out of towels. It was the most comical shapeless thing, this improvised doll, with no nose, mouth, ears or eyes nothing that even the imagination of a child could convert into a face. Curiously enough, the absence of eyes struck me more than all the other defects put together. I pointed this out to everybody with provoking persistency, but no one seemed equal to the task of providing the doll with eyes. A bright idea, however, shot into my mind, and the problem was solved. I tumbled off the seat and searched under it until I found my aunt's cape, which was trimmed with large beads. I pulled two beads off and indicated to her that I wanted her to sew them on my doll. She raised my hand to her eyes in a questioning way, and I nodded energetically.

        "Topic98":"Agatha Christie was one of England's most famous writers. Her crime and detective stores became famous for their clever plots. Agatha Christie was often called the queen of crime. Agatha Christie was born in Devon, England in 1890 as the daughter of a British army captain. During the First World War she worked in a hospital as a nurse. Later on she got a job in a pharmacy. This influenced many of her crime stories because some of her victims were poisoned. Agatha Christie was married twice and especially her second husband travelled a lot with her. Some of her novels, like ‘Death on the Nile’ were set in the Middle East. ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ was written in Istanbul. At the beginning of the 1970s Agatha Christie became ill, but she went on writing. When she died in 1976 she had written over 60 novels, 150 short stories and 16 plays. Her stage play ‘The Mousetrap’ is the longest running play in history. It was first performed in 1952 and after a record 23,000 performances it is still running today. Many of Christie's books and short stories have been turned into successful movies. In her works Agatha Christie created two great characters. Hercule Poirot is a Belgian detective who appeared in 33 of Agatha Christie's novels he his best known for his moustache. Poirot thinks logically and likes order. He examines the crime scene in detail and claims that every crime can be solved. As time went on Agatha Christie became tired of her Belgian detective and wanted to get rid of him. But he was very popular among her readers. When he died in ‘Curtain’ in 1978 he became the only fictional character to get an obituary in the New York Times. Agatha Christie's other well-known character was Miss Marple, an old woman who wants to be an amateur detective. She likes knitting, walking around the neighbourhood and she observes things very carefully. She became famous for solving cases where the police failed. In contrast to Hercule Poirot, Christie was very fond of Miss Marple. Almost all of Agatha Christie's novels are whodunits. They focus on English people of the middle and upper classes. Usually the detective comes across a murder scene by chance or is called by a friend who may be involved. He or she questions the suspects, examines the crime scene carefully and gives the reader clues so that they may have a chance to solve the crime themselves. In the course of the story one, or even a few, of the suspects usually die. Finally the detective gets all the suspects together and gives away information that not everyone knows, until the real murderer is revealed. In some of Agatha Christie's stories the murderer escapes justice; sometimes they get killed. Twice the murderer turns out to be the narrator of the story.",
        "Topic99":"For more than 4,000 years people in Asia have used acupuncture to treat illnesses. It is an old Chinese form of healing in which your skin is pierced with thin needles to relieve pain. Today acupuncture is also very popular in Europe, America and Australia. Acupuncture can control pain and sickness. It can also be used if you have a headache or back pain. Some doctors use acupuncture along with regular treatments for asthma, high blood pressure or stress. Doctors have even used acupuncture to stop pain during an operation. Some people think that acupuncture can treat depression and even help people to stop smoking. Many patients feel more energy after a treatment, while others may feel more relaxed. People who practice acupuncture must take courses to learn how to do it correctly. In many places, especially outside of Asia, only doctors are allowed to perform acupuncture. During treatment the patient lies on and needles are stuck into certain points of the body. There are hundreds of possible points and each one has a certain effect on the body. The points can also be very far away from the place of pain. For example you stick a needle into the hand to treat problems with your stomach. Acupuncture needles are made of metal and about as thick as a human hair. They normally go less than one cm into the skin. When they are in the skin the acupuncturist may twist them or send electricity through them. The patients rest for a short time and then the needles are removed. Acupuncture normally doesn't hurt. There is also a milder form of acupuncture called acupressure where you don't need needles. Doctors use their fingers to press the points of the body. Chinese medicine teaches us that all acupuncture points are located along pathways called meridians. Each of these meridians carries energy, which the Chinese call ‘qi’ to certain Acupuncture - Sticking Needles into Patients points of the body. If this ‘qi’ gets blocked from an area the person will get sick or feel pain. Sticking needles into the correct points can help ‘qi’ flow again and make the person well. Doctors today are not sure how acupuncture really works. They have not found any proof that these pathways of energy really exist. Some think that needles cause the body to produce pain killing substances. Others think that the needles block pain signals that travel along the nerves to the brain. Some also say that acupuncture only works because patients believe in it.",
        "Topic100":"Demonetization has achieved judicial closure. The 4-1 Supreme Court constitution bench verdict termed the November 8, 2016 announcement as an executive decision, where the judiciary does not have the expertise to supplant economic policies, unless manifest arbitrariness requires intervention. The bench majority also refrained from identifying an alternative measure that would have constrained citizens’ rights less, saying these are ‘areas purely within the domain of experts and beyond the arena of judicial review’. This is a principle SC needs to consistently uphold, given the number of frivolous PILs it entertains and the intrusion into policy they entail. But the diversity of public opinions on demonetization was mirrored in SC too. Justice BV Nagarathna in the minority ruled the exercise unlawful but said the status quo ante can’t be restored as the event happened in 2016. She ruled that the Constitution empowers Centre to demonetize currency but the exercise should have been implemented through a law of Parliament. She faulted its implementation by a gazette notification saying that route is available only when RBI is proposing demonetization under Section 26(2) RBI Act. Additionally, she faulted RBI for lacking ‘independent application of mind’ while ‘recommending’ what Centre desired. Neither the majority nor minority verdicts examined whether demonetization met its stated objectives – because that wasn’t the bench’s job. Demonetization is hard to support in terms of economic policy logic. The economic impact was negative, even if subsequent research showed that the quantum was less than initially feared. It’s doubtful whether it dealt a body blow to the black economy or to the cash-based transactions that support such activities. Cash in hand of the public now is double that of 2016. Even if only for some weeks, it put a lot of people through immense hardship. One positive consequence was that digital payments got a big boost, and the habit stayed with Indians even after new currency notes became plentiful. But an economic shock is not the best way to encourage digital payments. The considerable economic slowdown in 2018 and 2019 was probably a combination of demonetization, GST introduction, which unlike demonetization was a necessary reform, and the NBFC meltdown. None of that matters for SC, of course. But the successful conclusion of the demonetization hearings should act as an incentive to set up more constitution benches for other long pending matters.",
        "Topic101":"The world of chatbots is hotting up. Google on Monday said that a new artificial intelligence (AI) service named Bard is being tested ahead of a public launch. It’s a conversational service which can provide textual answers to questions raised by users. Bard’s public launch will make it the second generative AI, after ChatGPT, to be freely accessible. Generative AI represents another dimension where the technology has moved beyond pattern recognition to synthesising answers from large data sets. AI doesn’t have a precise definition. It’s best described as a constellation of technologies. The idea arises from English mathematician Alan Turing’s work in 1950 where he suggested a machine could be programmed to learn from experience in the way children do. The idea has now fructified, and AI is transforming every conceivable area of activity. Acknowledging its importance, the budget announced that three centres of excellence in AI will be set up in top educational institutions, with the private sector contributing to the effort. GoI has taken the right step as AI, the world’s most disruptive technology, is growing everywhere on the back of a collaborative effort between the state and private sector. GoI’s foremost contribution to making India a key centre in the global AI network will have to be in research. Not all of it can generate commercial returns immediately. However, the long-term payoffs are invaluable. A lot of US government support to domestic AI development is routed through its defence industry. China, the other AI powerhouse, has thrown the weight of the state’s resources behind its attempt to dominate. Large-scale funding and creation of research ecosystems that draw in global Indian talent in AI need to be GoI’s priorities. AI is already in extensive use at the commercial level. Indian firms have access to domestic talent to leverage these opportunities. It now needs to be complemented by access to data. AI rests on three pillars: data, algorithms and computing power. Indian firms need a sound regulatory framework that allows access to a lot more anonymised data. A GoI expert committee suggested open access to non-personal data. India’s lagging in establishing a legal framework to both safeguard privacy and provide open access to anonymised data for Indian startups. This needs to be addressed soon. AI is the technological frontier that offers India a chance to leapfrog a few stages.",
        "Topic102":"The point you likely won’t hear Assam CM make during his shock campaign against child marriages is that despite the arrest of around 2,500 men since Friday, each of the marriages remains valid. The only path to making them voidable that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, provides is a nullity petition in the district court ‘by a contracting party to the marriage who was a child at the time of the marriage’. The wives protesting outside police stations are not interested in filing such a petition. In media interviews some of them have professed love for the husband; some have children in tow, for many the arrested husband is the sole breadwinner for the family. Sarma’s because itself is not a lonely one. Indeed it is through society-wide efforts that India has reduced child marriage. NFHS surveys show that the 54% of women aged 20-24 married before age 18 in 1992-93, became 47% in 2005-06, and then 23% by 2019-21. Obviously change is picking up pace. But experts are clear that it is rising education and income that have delivered this change. This is also why Parliament and Centre haven’t wielded the blunt instrument that is being deployed in Assam today. They have recognised that economic and educational development is very uneven across the country, and that child marriages remain the most common among the most deprived populations. States that have gone further include Karnataka, which ten years after Parliament passed PCMA amended it to declare every child marriage void ab initio, but only thenceforth. Sharply in contrast in Assam, the severe action is retrospective and it was not even preceded by adequate awareness-raising. A survey of the arrested may find that many were knowingly defying PCMA, but many others either didn’t know of it or thought government was uninterested in enforcing it because that’s what government’s actions over the past one and a half decades indicated to them. Plus the mass arrests mean that the due process expected in individualised cases will take a hit, and there is not even any bail on the table here. ‘One generation will have to suffer,’ Sarma has said. But why? Breaking thousands of settled families against their wishes and in a way that leaves some of them literally destitute, is just not justified. Listen to the protesting women.",
        "Topic103":"For the third time in a month the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) failed to elect its mayor after AAP and BJP councilors again engaged in a row over the election process. This MCD conflict is an extension of the years-long tussle between the two parties over the administration of the national capital. Given Delhi’s unique governance structure with a multiplicity of authorities, ideally the state and central governments should be working in harmony. But in times of hyper-competitive politics, such an understanding has remained elusive. True, in the absence of a mayor – as well as deputy mayor and standing committee – a special officer is in charge. But major decisions related to policy matters, development works and projects that require big financial investment are delayed. Surprisingly, MCD isn’t the only municipal body in this position. For close to a year, the Brihan mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – the country’s richest civic body – has been managed by an administrator after its term expired and polls were delayed. Further, an astonishing 22 of 28 municipal corporations in Maharashtra have seen their terms expire with fresh polls nowhere in sight. Such atrophy also undermines local democracy. The Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992 provided for the creation of urban local bodies and empowered state governments to devolve the responsibility of 18 functions including urban planning, regulation of land use, water supply etc. But a 2020 paper by PRS Legislative Research found that most state governments are reluctant to share power and taxes with local bodies. This severely curtails urban governance at a time when 675 million Indians are slated to live in urban centers by 2035. They need smarter cities, which needs empowered instead of stalled local bodies. Mumbai needs municipal elections. Delhi needs a mayor.",
        "Topic104":"The Nifty 50 stock index ended Friday’s session at 17,845.05, a gain of 1% over the week. One of its constituents, Adani Enterprise, recorded a 50% fall in its price during the week to close at Rs 1531. The sharp divergence here is an indicator of the underlying optimism in the Indian economy which an index of diverse companies captures. The optimism about India’s economic future has shown up for a while. Two trends are worth highlighting. In 2022, global economic and geopolitical disruptions led to a net FII outflow of $16.5 billion in Indian equities. Yet, the bellwether BSE Sensex rose 4.4% during 2022. The FII outflow was more than offset by the emergence of Indian retail investors in equity as a countervailing force. Take mutual fund SIPs, a proxy for retail investment. Since September 2021, the monthly inflow has exceeded Rs 10,000 crore every month. In 2022-23, the annual inflow is set to more than double what was collected five years ago. The growing interest of retail Indian investment in Indian equities is a positive development. It helps households capture the gains of economic growth and also helps firms by providing a more diverse pool of investors. While GoI has taken pains to reassure investors on the integrity of market systems, the performance of Adani group shares indicates uncertainty. It’s this fear that regulators need to address in India’s larger economic interest. The diversification of Indian household savings is essential.",
        "Topic105":"Any hope of a New Year thaw in the Ukraine conflict was blown away by Ukraine’s offensive in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region. Of course, Russia has been conducting night-time air strikes against Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. So, the world wearily wonders whether the continuing war will deliver fresh economic shocks, even as economies are yet to recover from shocks delivered last year. Millions across countries have seen prices go up and real incomes drop, energy and food becoming more expensive and bank credit get dearer. Ukraine has suffered terribly, and Russia, despite its leadership’s bravado, has suffered too. But every day of the war is Christmas Day for global arms manufacturers. Since the beginning of the conflict last February, defence companies have seen their stocks rise as the West rushed military aid to Kyiv. Many of these weapons came from reserve stockpiles of Western countries, requiring these systems to be replenished through fresh contracts to arms makers. And while Europe has upped its contribution in recent months, the US still remains the largest individual contributor towards weapons for Ukraine, committing $18.5 billion till November 20. In December, Washington announced another $1.85 billion in military aid for Kyiv, which included the Patriot air defence system. The US defence budget will hit a record $858 billion – bigger than Switzerland’s GDP – this year out of which at least $800 million will go towards security assistance to Ukraine. The defence bill authorises specific purchases from arms companies like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics whose systems have already marked their presence on the Ukrainian frontline. In fact, the American Himars rocket launcher used by the Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk strike was probably of Lockheed Martin make. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that American defence companies are having a good time. Lockheed Martin’s share price over the past year grew by 11%, Northrop Grumman by 23%, and Aero Vironment by 21%. Arms manufacturers like wars. And they must be loving the Ukraine-Russia conflict, which has the potential to carry on for months more. That’s another very good reason to try and wage peace in Ukraine.",
        "Topic106":"Quake-hit Turkiye and Syria hold a big lesson for India. The tragedy in those two countries would have been less severe had authorities in affected areas not tolerated poor construction and rampant violation of building code. This sounds scarily familiar in this country. Parts of the Indian peninsula lie in a seismically volatile zone – where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Around 59% of India is prone to earthquakes of different magnitudes – 11% in the very high-risk Zone V (Kashmir Valley, western Himachal, eastern Uttarakhand, the Northeast, Rann of Kutch), 18% in high-risk Zone IV (Delhi, parts of Maharashtra, Haryana, UP, Bengal and Bihar), and 30% in Zone III (Kerala, Goa, Lakshadweep, parts of MP, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh). It’s not that India doesn’t have norms for earthquake-resistant construction. There is the National Building Code (NBC), 2016, with specific sections on earthquake-resistant design and construction. But there’s no law asking for compliance. In Delhi an estimated 90% of buildings are at risk of collapsing in case of a strong earthquake. In 2019, MCD had drafted a safety audit policy to protect buildings from earthquakes. But this failed to take off because the onus of conducting and paying for the audit was put on the public. True, there’s a cost in incorporating earthquake-resistant changes in buildings – 3-4% extra of total construction cost for residential buildings and 2-3% extra for offices. Surely, this is a cost worth bearing for saving lives and property. There are two ways forward. First, there needs to be greater public awareness about NBC guidelines to boost voluntary compliance. And second, municipalities should be encouraged to adopt NBC guidelines in their building bye-laws, making them mandatory. Earthquakes can’t be predicted, but measures to minimize loss of lives must be prioritized.",
        "Topic107":"When the Supreme Court granted legal status to the concept of ‘advance medical directives’ in 2018 and allowed passive euthanasia, subject to stringent safeguards. it was seen as a vital recognition of both patient autonomy over end-of-life decisions and the right to a dignified death. However, doctors later found that some of the specific directions turned out to be ‘insurmountable obstacles’. In a recent order, a Constitution Bench modified the directions to make them more workable and simple. The advance directive no more needs to be countersigned by a judicial magistrate. Instead, it could be attested before a notary or a gazetted officer. Instead of the magistrate, it is enough if the notary or officer is satisfied that the document is executed voluntarily, without coercion or inducement, and with full understanding. The original guideline that the executor should name a guardian or a close relative who would be authorized to give consent to refuse or withdraw medical treatment, in the event of the executor becoming incapable of a decision, has been modified to name more than one guardian or relative. Instead of the magistrate being tasked with informing family members about the document, in case they are not present at the time of its being executed, the onus is now on the persons themselves to hand over a copy of the advance directive to the guardians or close relatives named in it, as well as to the family physician. It may also be included in digital health records. The new guidelines require the hospital itself to constitute a primary medical board to certify whether the instructions on refusal or withdrawal of treatment should be carried out. The hospital should also form a secondary board, including a doctor nominated by the district’s chief medical officer, which will have to endorse the primary board’s certificate. The change here is that the district Collector need not constitute the second medical board, as required in the 2018 judgment. The scrutiny by the boards holds good even in cases in which there is no advance directive, but the patient is not in a position to make any decision. The new guidelines also spell out the experience and specializations of those to be included in the medical boards. While such guidelines are useful and necessary to implement the concept of a ‘living will’ and advance medical directives, it is time Parliament came out with a comprehensive law. Such a law could also provide for a repository of advance directives so that the need to ascertain afresh its genuine nature does not arise at the time of its implementation.",
        "Topic108":"A Test rivalry high on epic contests and stirring comebacks gets its latest edition as India and Australia face off in the first Test at Nagpur from Thursday. The Ashes and games involving India and Pakistan have their share of history and hype and within that ecosystem, India and Australia have fashioned a unique fabric that has shimmered bright ever since V.V.S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Singh dished out magic at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens in 2001. There should be riveting fare during this four-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a silverware upon which India has had a better hold especially during the last decade, be it at home or away. The usual surround-sound may have been muted and only now have whispers started about spin-friendly pitches. While that surface tension lingers, Usman Khawaja’s delayed departure to India over a visa issue does not reflect well on bureaucratic red tape that perhaps got triggered since the Australian’s roots are in Pakistan. Pat Cummins and his men have trained away from the flashbulbs, preferring to be holed up at the Alur ground on the outskirts of Bengaluru. On abrasive pitches against their own spinners and local talent, Steve Smith and company have finessed their skill sets against the slow art. As the Test caravan moves across Nagpur, Delhi, Dharamshala and Ahmedabad, a lot more is at stake in this bilateral skirmish. The ICC Test Championship is heading towards its business end with the final scheduled at London’s Oval from June 7 to 11. June may seem far, but, for the Test cycle, there is not much time left as April and May are linked to the Indian Premier League T20 tournament. Australia with 75.56 percentage points leads the table ahead of India (58.93), Sri Lanka (53.33) and South Africa (48.72). With one foot in the final, Australia will sail through even with one draw and three losses against India. However, a 0-4 drubbing from India in tandem with Sri Lanka defeating New Zealand twice, would mean that Cummins and gang will miss the final. Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma’s men can keep their championship hopes alive by winning the series 4-0 or 3-1. However, a 2-2 draw against Australia along with Sri Lanka winning 2-0 in New Zealand would mean that India will fall below the top two and miss the summit clash. The Indian squad holds the edge but Australia is keen to rewrite history. And the cherry on the cake would be a berth in the Test championship final.",
        "Topic109":"As a State used to coalition governments and the fluid loyalties of its politicians, Meghalaya has had at least a third of its 60 MLAs hopping parties during the five-year term of the outgoing Assembly. Even in the run-up to the elections scheduled for February 27, a National People’s Party (NPP) candidate flipped sides to become the Bharatiya Janata Party’s candidate, and a Congress candidate switched to the Trinamool Congress (TMC). In 2018, the Congress had won 21 seats, the NPP 20, the BJP 2, and regional parties and independents the rest. Meghalaya is the only State among the three in the northeast going to the polls now where the Congress has a fighting chance. The party, once the main political force in Meghalaya, has no MLA though it was the single-largest party in 2018. The BJP is contesting all 60 seats in the hope of reaching a double-digit figure. The TMC, which became the State’s Opposition party overnight after 12 Congress MLAs switched over in November 2021, is fielding 55 candidates. The most influential regional entity, the United Democratic Party, is contesting 46 seats. The State’s politics is driven by the dynamics of three matrilineal tribes — the Khasi and Jaintia tribes that are ethnically closer, and the Garo tribe which held the Chief Minister’s chair for 34 years since the formation of the State over 50 years ago. The Garos have often sought a separate State, although the demand has been somewhat muted this time. The Khasi-Jaintia Hills encompass 36 of the State’s 60 seats, and the Garo Hills 24 seats. The ruling NPP and prime challenger, the TMC, are facing off in the Garo Hills, where the contest is the most intense. The issue of Bangladeshi immigrants, a staple of Assam elections, entered Meghalaya this time with the NPP and the BJP trying to portray the TMC as a Bengali party sympathetic to people from India’s neighbor. The TMC and its allies have been accusing the NPP of misrule, and large-scale graft in power, health, education, PDS and other sectors besides striking a ‘lopsided’ deal with Assam to resolve border disputes. The allies have washed their hands of the record of the government that they have been part of, trying to shift the full blame onto the NPP. Allies say the NPP called the shots and never consulted them on any issue. Allies in the outgoing government are contesting against it, with each one trying to maximise their strength in the Assembly and keeping post-poll options open.",
        "Topic110":"Amid protests in Uttarakhand’s Joshimath over deepening cracks in houses, the district administration has halted road and power plant construction works in the town’s vicinity. There’s little doubt that aggressive construction in recent decades has brought the ancient town to this pass. Multi-storeyed buildings, blasting hills for a hydropower project tunnel and road building to accommodate more traffic have aggravated the condition of a town, already standing on weak foundations. From 1976 to 2022, multiple government committees sounded dire warnings to stop heavy construction activities – but all went unheeded. The Garhwal division is among India’s most vulnerable regions. The 2013 Uttarakhand floods, and last year’s Chamoli disaster caused by a rock and ice avalanche that killed 200 people in Joshimath’s vicinity and damaged two hydel projects, foretell the devastation that the next Himalayan flood could wreak. But signals from governments, both state and Centre, suggest that big ticket highway and power projects, already underway for a decade or so, will continue. Surely, the frequent cave-ins and landslides marring these projects require changes in the development strategy, before it is too late. Even the quality of environment impact assessment done to clear projects is sometimes in doubt. Manipur’s government decided to ‘revisit’ the Imphal-Jiribam rail link’s EIA after a landslide during construction killed 60 persons in June last year. While Railways blamed shifting cultivation, others point fingers at extensive tunnelling through a landslide-prone zone. With ambitious timelines to meet, adequate assessment of landslide risks or proper preliminary structural engineering works to stabilise subsequent constructions suffer. Uttarakhand CM P.S. Dhami’s second term in office gives him the mandate to take tough eco-friendly measures. This may dampen economic growth and job creation, but dangers of a huge ecological disaster are increasing. For administrators in hilly and coastal regions, these are tough but necessary calls to make.",
        "Topic111":"The egregiously behaved passenger, Shankar Mishra, aboard the now infamous Air India flight from New York to New Delhi is, as of now, an absconder from law. But it should have never come to a police hunt. As reported first by TOI, Mishra urinated on a fellow passenger, a senior citizen, during the flight and was allowed to get away by the crew. What Mishra did falls squarely within the parameters of unruly behaviour flagged in the aviation regulator DGCA’s rules issued in September 2017. They exist as even one unruly passenger can jeopardise safety on board. The regulator has rightly issued show cause notices to the relevant staffers in the airline, seeking an explanation for their lapse. There are several disquieting aspects about the performance of the airline crew and AI. Both the crew and ground staff are expected to be trained to manage unruly passengers. Therefore, given Mishra’s in-flight conduct, he should have been dealt with on November 26, the day of the flight, not in early January. That he was allowed to walk away by the flight crew and ground staff of AI after reportedly reaching an ‘understanding’ with the other passenger is irrelevant as far as the crew’s duties are concerned. They should have acted as per DGCA rules. What is worse is that in a December 6 international flight, AI crew also reportedly allowed an unruly passenger and the victim to strike bilateral agreements. In the November incident, the airline’s statement says a police complaint was filed later. There are several questions about the speed with which AI moved. Did the airline follow protocol or did it require escalation of the complaint to the company’s highest levels before action was initiated? That Mishra had the luxury of absconding to evade the arrest shows that AI’s procedural failures compounded its in-flight failures. The airline in a statement said the passenger has been placed on a 30-day no-fly list and the matter has been referred to an internal committee for investigation. That’s as per rules which also say if AI’s internal committee’s investigation overshoots 30 days, the no-fly categorisation will end. Let’s hope AI remembers that. AI was in the news earlier for micromanaging its crew’s appearances. Most AI flyers would rather have a crew that can manage and report badly behaved passengers, never mind the crew’s hair styles. For Tatas, AI is an acquisition they need to manage very well – given the potential brand impact.",
        "Topic112":"Economic Survey 2022-23 has forecast that India’s growth in fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 6-6.8%. This translates into a baseline growth of 6.5%. IMF’s global economic forecast, which was released a day before the Survey, said India will grow at 6.1% in 2023-24. The growth forecasts are largely in line with earlier estimates and in this calendar year China and India together will account for 50% of the global growth. These estimates need to be located in the context of the prevailing geopolitical uncertainty. The Survey’s range of 0.8 percentage points in GDP forecast is an indicator of it. Three key developments will impact India’s growth and inflation trajectories. IMF expects China to return to normalcy after it abandoned its zero-Covid policy. Consequently, China will not only be the largest contributor to global growth in 2023, it will also help the latter perform a little better than forecast earlier. IMF expects the global economy to grow 2.9% this year. Global inflation will trend downwards 6.6% this year. This may be an over 2 percentage point fall but it remains elevated. Some of the uncertainty in India’s growth-inflation dynamics comes from China’s return to normalcy. The biggest source of uncertainty remains the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It’s almost a year since it began and there are signs that it may further intensify. Given these dynamics at play, the Survey points to some domestic developments which need to be pursued. GoI debt to GDP ratio, which was between 45-50% for about 15 years prior to the pandemic, ballooned to 59%. Over the last two years, it’s been lowered but is still high at around 57%. The trend towards pushing it down needs to continue. Unless that happens, the full potential of another fiscal feature will not play out. A highlight of the spending pattern across all levels of government in the last two years is a shift towards capital expenditure. For GoI, it has increased from about 12-13% of total expenditure to almost 16% in 2021-22 and is budgeted at 19% in 2022-23. This is an essential dimension of fiscal policy as it can crowd-in private investment as corporate and bank balance sheets have been repaired. However, if public debt is not lowered, potential private investment can be crowded out by high interest rates. Fiscal policy now should focus on consolidation and stability.",
        "Topic113":"India has sent an all-women platoon of peacekeepers to Abyei, Sudan, the second such deployment after its trailblazing female peacekeeping police unit to Liberia in 2007, which the then Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, lauded as an inspiration and a prompt for recruiting more women in the Liberian police. After the Indian women peacekeeping force left, Liberian women made up 17% of the country’s security sector, up from 6% before their arrival. Scholarship has established that when women make decisions, the risks of war and conflict reduce. But women’s role in conflict resolution and stability is only lately being acknowledged and boosted. And there’s a long way to go. As of 2020, out of 95,000 UN peacekeepers, women made up only 4.8% of military contingents and 10.9% of police units. A Swedish study found that civil society groups including women’s organisations make a peace agreement about 64% less likely to fail. And when women participate in peace processes, the agreement is 35% more likely to last at least 15 years. Women face the worst brunt of war, in terms of sexual violence and abuse as well as displacement. To see fellow women in authority can encourage women to reclaim public life without fear. The same lesson holds for India at home. Women will be safer if there are many more women in all ranks in various government branches, including police.",
        "Topic114":"France today is bracing for massive protests led by its unions as the French government tries to push through highly unpopular pension reforms. The country’s pension system is one of the most generous in the world. But it has long been known to be unsustainable. The entire system cost Paris just under 14% of GDP in 2021. Plus, a report last year by the Pensions Advisory Council – a French state body – predicted the system will run into deficit in a not-too-distant future. For example, by 2027 the pension deficit will be almost $12 billion. While this may not seem high compared to the total pension outgo of $381 billion, it needs to be juxtaposed with the fact that French public debt reached record high levels of 115% of GDP last year. Additionally, the Ukraine war has put extra strain on European economies that are now battling high inflation and energy crunches. So, President Macron is not wrong in seeking an increase in the minimum retirement age for most people from 62 to 64. Given increasing life expectancy, the ratio of French senior citizens to working age population is slated to jump from 37:100 in 2020 to 55:100 by 2050. And France is not alone. Faced with burgeoning public debt and demographic decline, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium all plan to lift the minimum retirement age to 67 over the coming years – the UK will lift it to 68. Besides, there is a strategic aspect too. If France is to play a more robust geopolitical role, both in Europe and across the world, it must boost its economy and make it more vibrant. And supporting businesses through tax cuts would certainly require pension reforms. But Macron needs to manage the protests well. For, Russia is already looking to fish in troubled waters. Politically undermining Macron and breaking EU unity over Ukraine will be a victory for Moscow.",
        "Topic115":"The latest stock market gyrations induced in large measure by the stock rout in leading infrastructure and commodities intensive conglomerate, the Adani group, over the last two trading sessions last week has cast the spotlight back on India’s regulatory environment. The highly leveraged group’s market troubles, in the wake of a U.S.-based short seller’s report alleging ‘stock manipulation and questionable accounting practices’, dragged down banking shares led by the State Bank of India and even the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) appreciably on Friday, triggering investor concern about broader financial sector stability. And while a media report citing sources said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had stepped up scrutiny of the conglomerate’s transactions, there has been no official word from the markets regulator. The conglomerate itself has rubbished the short seller’s allegations as being ‘baseless and discredited and born of mala fide intent to hurt the group’s reputation’, and is weighing legal action. Notwithstanding how the conglomerate might move to address the concerns raised in the short seller’s report as well as those of domestic investors who appear to have turned chary of the group’s stocks, India’s regulators including SEBI and the Reserve Bank of India have an opportunity, nay an obligation, to clear the air by allaying fears of any broader systemic contagion. Even granting that the group’s stocks do not have a significant presence or weight on the major benchmark stock indices, and private equity research reports have sought to downplay concerns about the banking sector’s overall exposure to the group, there can be little argument that the major state-owned banks and the LIC are key pillars of the country’s financial system. Given the extent of public trust reposed in these companies in the form of savers’ deposits and life insurance policies as well as taxpayer resources that have been invested to keep the PSU lenders adequately capitalised, financial system regulators would be serving the larger public interest by pre-emptively communicating messages of reassurance. Regulators could also enhance credibility in India as an investment destination by tightening not just the listing requirements but more crucially the enforcement actions in case of egregious breaches of the laws. The global debate over the credibility of credit ratings that has surfaced from time to time, whether in the wake of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, or the global financial crisis of 2007-08, is also a concern that India’s regulators need to re-engage with. At a time when India holds the G-20 presidency, authorities must ensure the regulatory framework is seen in nothing less than the best light.",
        "Topic116":"After 135 days on the road, the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Yatra ended in Srinagar, on the Mahatma’s death anniversary, with several Opposition leaders attending the unfurling of the tricolor. That the yatra, or at least its south-to-north version, finished thus, was a befitting end to an arduous journey made by a leader seeking to revive the fortunes of the beleaguered Congress. The yatra’s objective was to emphasise the contrast between the party’s vision for India, built on its slogan of ‘unity in diversity’, and the Hindutva ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The party’s outreach might not have immediately resuscitated its electoral fortunes — there has been a steady decline in its influence and a flight of many of its leaders to the BJP. But the imagery of the Congress scion interacting with civil society and the citizenry across the country, and just the organisation of the yatra infused energy into the political machine of India’s grand old party. The yatra’s messaging might have been rudimentary and a medley of slogans, but it did clearly articulate some of the party’s distinctive core values to a large extent. This was even more evident in the optics in Srinagar. Jammu and Kashmir has been India’s most conflict-ridden province and now, inexplicably, remains a Union Territory after having its special status abruptly stripped and being bifurcated into two Union Territories in 2019. In the succeeding years, there has been heightened violence in the Kashmir Valley, the weakening of the mainstream polity (which was bracketed with the separatist current for a period of time), and the imposition of communication lockdowns and measures to control the freedom of the press. After months of turmoil, Kashmir has limped back to economic activity, with the tourism sector picking up well, but the sense of disquiet with the abrupt changes has persisted in the Valley and beyond. Repeated incidents of violence against Kashmiri Pandits have also been indicative of the persisting turmoil. The presence of the Peoples Democratic Party and the National Conference in the flag hoisting ceremony in Srinagar was proof of the extent of the appeal of the yatra for the mainstream parties in the Valley, and in a way marks a genuine attempt at solidarity between the Kashmiri polity and the national opposition. Yet, in terms of the actual steps for the Congress’s revival, there is still many a proverbial mile to go with the party requiring to do the hard yards in building organisational relevance in several parts of the country, especially in North India.",
        "Topic117":"Rapidly changing fortunes of the 4,000-plus families in Haldwani, Uttarakhand, hold a lesson for governments. After the Uttarakhand high court directed Railways, which claimed the land, and the state to use the paramilitary forces to evict families, the Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the order. The underlying issues have a long history of jurisprudence, with the SC’s landmark 1985 judgment in the Olga Tellis case providing guidelines. In that case, while SC said that encroachment cannot be automatically legalised, the right to livelihood imposes checks against arbitrariness in evictions. Livelihood lies at the heart of encroachments or slums. Census 2011 said 13.7 million urban households were in slums, with as many as 41.3% households in Greater Mumbai in that category. Slum dwellers are intrinsic to the economic life of urban areas. To illustrate, 70.2% of slum households are owned, a percentage point higher than urban average. It’s a proxy indicator of two aspects. Slum dwellers have livelihoods and aspirations like the middle class. Also, some government bodies formally recognise claims and provide paperwork. Given this context, the core question is why are there slums when their residents are integral to the urban economic landscape? The answer to that lies in the failure of urban planning and governance, especially the master plans that become irrelevant soon after they are accepted. Urban planners and the attendant governance framework are out of sync with the speed with which urban economies evolve. One of the symptoms of this failure is slums. As India’s jurisprudence has spelt out, occupation doesn’t mean ownership. However, the livelihood factor comes into play here mainly because of state failure in providing pathways to a better life in cities, which are India’s growth engines.",
        "Topic118":"Picturesque Ladakh has been on edge ever since it was carved out as a Union Territory (UT) from the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. After a brief period of jubilation over the status of a separate UT, a long-pending demand from Buddhists of the region, the locals have only grown restive. An agitation demanding the inclusion of the region in the Sixth Schedule under Article 244 of the Constitution (special protection to tribal populations) boiled over last week after Sonam Wangchuk, a Magsaysay winner, went on a fast. Soon after its creation as a UT in August 2019, Ladakh came under a bureaucracy that the local population found to be hostile and irresponsive. The constant tussle between locals, elected representatives of two Hill Councils of Kargil and Leh, and the bureaucracy only widened over the months. Leh’s political and religious bodies formed the Leh Apex Body (LAB) in 2020, headed by former BJP leader and former Member of Parliament Thupstan Chhewang (he is also an elected president of the influential Ladakh Buddhist Association). In Kargil district, political parties, including the National Conference and the Congress, and Shia Muslim-affiliated seminaries joined hands in November 2020 to form the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA). Kargil, unlike Leh, is for re-joining with the erstwhile J&K State and restoration of its special status under Article 370. Despite the differences in their political stands, LAB and the KDA are now together over common goals. They have put forth four major demands before the Centre, which include restoration of full-fledged Statehood, constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule, separate Lok Sabha seats for Leh and Kargil districts and job reservation for locals. They describe the demands as key to protecting Ladakh’s identity, culture and the fragile environment. The Centre appears to be in a bind as the two committees it appointed to reassure the local populations have made little headway in the last two years. In fact the second committee appointed this year under Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai has only deepened local anger, as it has no mandate to address the issues being raised. Ladakh witnessed a major military incursion from China in 2020, just 10 months after J&K’s special status was scrapped and the erstwhile State divided. That conflict remains unresolved. In the absence of drastic measures to assuage the locals by meeting their genuine demands, the region will only remain embroiled to the advantage of those intent on fomenting trouble.",
        "Topic119":"The last time China’s population saw a decline was in 1961, in the midst of a devastating four-year famine following Mao’s failed ‘Great Leap Forward’ campaign. The latest decline in population, however, is no blip. The shrinking of the world’s most populous country by as much as 8,50,000 in 2022 marks a watershed moment with lasting consequences for China and the world. Beijing announced on January 17 that births in China last year dropped by more than 10% to 9.56 million, with 10.41 million deaths. The 1.411 billion population will certainly be overtaken by India’s this year. China’s population story holds lessons for countries that have tried robust interventions in social engineering. China has spent the greater part of two decades trying — and failing — to get families to boost birth rates that have been declining since the government introduced a harsh ‘one-child policy’ in 1980. The belated introduction in 2016 of a ‘two-child policy’ to course correct was not met with the enthusiasm that planners had expected for a relaxation announced with fanfare. A government survey found that 70% would not have more children citing financial reasons. China’s economy is already feeling the impact of demographic change. The 16-59 working age population (2022), was 875 million, a decline of around 75 million since 2010. Wages are rising, and labour-intensive jobs are moving out, predominantly to Southeast Asia. The above-60 population, meanwhile, had increased by 30 million to 280 million. The number of elderly will peak at 487 million by 2050 (35% of the population). China’s National Working Commission on ageing estimates spending on health care for the elderly will take up 26% of the GDP by 2050. Signs are China is already on track to follow Japan’s example of a prolonged period of a shrinking workforce with declining growth. As a paper from Japan’s Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry pointed out, the proportion of child and elderly populations in China as of 2020 was similar to Japan’s in 1990. Moreover, China reached this inflection point faster, with its fertility rate falling from 2.74 to 1.28 in the preceding four-decade period, while Japan’s fell from 1.75 to 1.29. The paper pointed out that India’s proportion of child and elderly population in 2020 was similar to China’s in 1980, just when its economic boom took off. That was made possible only by making the most of its demographic dividend by investing heavily in health care and education to fashion a workforce capable of powering what would become the world’s factory.",
        "Topic120":"December 2022 marked the steepest fall in two years for India’s goods exports, with products worth $34.5 billion shipped out — 12.2% lower than a year ago. This was the second time in three months that shipments dropped year-on-year and top Commerce Ministry officials sought to calm nerves by citing the global headwinds that were posing challenges for Indian merchandise. These include the clouds of recession blowing through Europe and the U.S., the COVID-19 situation in China and a reversion towards protectionism in some markets. To be clear, a high base effect also played a role in exaggerating the year-on-year export dip in December. December 2021 had clocked the second highest exports (worth $39.3 billion) in 2021-22, when India’s goods shipments crossed a record $422 billion. The world’s trade dynamics have been altered since then, as the momentum swung from a strong post-pandemic pent-up rebound to a stuttering growth trajectory amid soaring inflation and geopolitical muddling, with the Ukraine-Russia conflict counting as only one of the many shocks to the global economy through 2022. Amid these tumultuous times, a month-on-month reading of export trends is perhaps a better way to gauge the situation. For now, December’s export numbers, even if lifted by the last batches of pre-holiday festive shipments reaching their destined shores, hold up well on this front vis-à-vis October and November’s initial trade estimates. The other silver lining is that imports also contracted 3.5% in December, the first such instance since November 2020, although they remained flat sequentially at around $58.2 billion. For the first nine months of 2022-23, India’s goods exports are still 9.1% higher than a year ago, slightly lower than the 11.1% rise recorded till November 2022. Some agencies expect the global recession to hit demand for Indian goods far harder in the current quarter so much so that the full year could still end up with a shrinkage in exports. In December itself, new export orders grew at the slowest pace in five months as firms struggled in key export markets, as per the S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index. The latest data on U.S. retail sales signal the sharpest slump in 12 months even as industrial output has tanked, signalling that demand for finished goods or inputs is set to slacken further in India’s top export destination. With China reopening, competition is expected to intensify even as demand shrinks. Some recent government moves such as fixing glitches in a duty remission scheme for exports and lifting curbs on iron ore shipments have helped, but more macro- and swifter micro-policy actions are warranted to keep the export engine chugging.",
        "Topic121":"In the week ahead, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her fifth and this government’s last full-fledged Budget before the Lok Sabha election in 2024. Although some electoral overtures can be made in an interim Budget next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government will also be mindful of the flurry of State elections scheduled through 2023. Ms. Sitharaman has an unenviable task of balancing the pulls and pressures on fiscal resources amid multiple congregating headwinds, keeping one eye on creating a feel-good factor among voters and the other on demonstrating suitable resolve to address India’s twin deficit situation and steer growth. Buoyant tax revenues this year provide comfort on meeting the fiscal deficit target (6.4% of GDP). The Finance Minister will need to show a convincing glide path to the 4.5% of GDP target laid down for 2025-26, but the widening current account deficit is of more emergent concern. Goods trade deficit hit an all-time high in the second quarter of this year, with net exports being the biggest external ‘drag’ on demand since late 2012-13. Ms. Sitharaman will look to raise customs duties on non-critical goods to slash the import bill, while trying to ensure Indian producers do not lose out on integration opportunities with global value chains with prohibitive or inverted duty structures for inputs and intermediates.  The export engine that has driven India’s growth well recently is likely to flounder this year even if the recession in the western world is milder than anticipated. Growth will be lower than the 7% expected this year, and the challenge is to prevent it from slipping below 6%. The Budget will persist with the public capex push with private investments yet to recover across the board. A chunk of the residual resources shall be earmarked for higher rural and social welfare spends, including food and fertilizer subsidies as well as schemes such as MGNREGA and PM-KISAN. Defence spending plans will be closely watched as they tend to be pruned in recent pre-poll Budgets. Constituencies awaiting succour such as the working middle class would like a revision of the tax exemption limit (set at ₹2.5 lakh a year in 2014) and other sops to alleviate the impact of high inflation on spending power. The government has not played to this gallery much in its innings, perhaps because it is not a vociferous or cohesive interest group such as farmers and corporates. But with an uneven recovery in consumption holding back the investment cycle, putting money into people’s hands to spur spending and facilitating more job opportunities for the youth, would be the best bet for India to drive its growth amid a tumultuous world economy.",
        "Topic122":"The Election Commission yesterday officially kicked off the election schedule for the year. While Tripura will vote on February 16, Nagaland and Meghalaya will go to polls on February 27. Counting for all will be held on March 2. With BJP President JP Nadda recently declaring the party’s intention to go all out in each of the nine assembly polls this year, keen contests await the Northeast. Of the poll-bound states, BJP is leading the state government in Tripura and is part of governing alliances in Meghalaya and Nagaland. BJP’s success lies in the combination of promoting a development narrative for the region coupled with clever coalition building. But two challenges also confront the party. First, it finds itself increasingly tangled in Northeast’s inter-state border disputes. For a region that still relies heavily on natural resources and continues to harbour strong ethnic identities, this is a sensitive issue pitting one BJP government against another, which rival parties are likely to exploit for political gains. Second, there is also a growing sense among BJP’s regional partners that the party is trying to expand at their own expense. For example, there are signs of strain in NPP’s relations with BJP since the two parties fought the Manipur polls separately last year. With NPP now declaring candidates for 58 out of 60 seats in Meghalaya, it could open up space for a party like TMC at the expense of BJP. True, BJP deserves credit for revoking the draconian AFSPA in significant parts of the Northeast last year. But full normalcy and end to regional insurgency that are crucial for economic growth hinge on concluding grand deals like the Naga Peace Accord. Meanwhile, BJP’s Hindi-heartland nationalist sentiments often elicit countervailing political mobilisation in the Northeast. In short, BJP’s aim of sweeping the poll-bound Northeast states to build political momentum for the rest of 2023 won’t be easy.",
        "Topic123":"GoI should withdraw parts of the draft Information Technology Rules that require social media companies to take down news articles if the Press Information Bureau identifies them as ‘fake news’. The regulations also allow GoI and its departments to authorise any other agency to perform this ‘fact-checking’ task on content involving government business. In essence, the regulation gives government, as an Editors Guild of India statement noted, ‘a carte blanche to determine what is fake or not with respect to its own work’. Of course, social media is awash with fake news – but credible news media isn’t, and news media, newspapers especially, employ several filters for checking veracity. Regulation of the press, which functions as a watchdog for citizens, is best done by an independent body. Rarely does one hear that news from a credible organisation is fake. Another reason not to involve government is that news often comes from government sources, who prefer anonymity for obvious reasons. Such stories become particularly vulnerable. The long-practised norm is for governments to reject or deny adverse stories. But the authority to term a story ‘fake’ or ‘false’ and get it taken down, puts government’s powers in a wholly different league, especially if it won’t offer any documentary evidence as to why a story is fake. Such newly acquired powers have the potential to stifle journalism, especially if GoI departments use this to take down critical stories. Among best practices of the Indian press is the publishing of corrections or apologies or voluntary take-down of articles when the sourcing or the facts are dubious and mistakes have been made. When such journalistic traditions are still being practised, arming a battery of government servants with extraordinary take-down powers is completely unnecessary.",
        "Topic124":"China in 2022 recorded a decline in population by 8.5 lakh, the first annual decline in six decades. But the last population decline came from famine, this one is a result of both a harsh and short-sighted population control policy and demographic transition from an agrarian society to an industrial one. Global experience, spanning Scandinavia to Singapore, shows that even generous fiscal incentives are unable to reverse a population decline once it’s set in. UN forecast India will be the most populous nation in the world in 2023. It’s important that India learns the right lessons from an unprecedented global demographic trend. Total fertility rate (TFR) the world over is crashing. The UN forecast the current global population of about 8 billion will rise to 9.7 billion by 2050. However, 66% of the increase will come because of momentum arising out of past growth. Therefore, the big challenge ahead is to avoid a situation where a country grows old before it gets rich. China already faces this problem and it’s unlikely to catch up with the US in per capita income terms. To illustrate, UN estimates by 2030, China’s population in the 19-60 age bracket at a little over 800 million will be about 10% lower than India. Demographic transition has two important phases. At the first stage, fertility rates fall. This, in turn, leads to the working age population growing faster than the overall population. It represents a potential demographic dividend when there’s an opportunity for a big spurt in growth and investment. It’s however not preordained. It requires the right mix of policy to make the most of this limited demographic window. Where does India stand? India’s TFR fell to a mere two in 2019-21 period, which is below the replacement rate. At present, World Bank data shows that India’s working age population is 68% versus a global average of 65%. Even in the age group up to 14 years, India’s share at 26% is a shade above the world average. But the problem is that not enough Indians are working, particularly women. Just 46% of India’s potential labour force is in the job market. Indonesia and Vietnam, in contrast, have 68% and 74% respectively in the job market. GoI must take this trend with utmost seriousness – India’s future depends on reversing it. There’s a real danger of frittering away the demographic dividend.",
        "Topic125":"Two of the recommendations that the Supreme Court collegium has reiterated this week had earlier been returned by government on account of the candidates’ social media posts. The point here is whether being ‘selectively critical … on the important policies, initiatives and directions of the government’ precludes one from becoming a judge. In the US, it does. Supreme and federal court justices there are nominated by the president and approved by the Senate by a majority vote. Some state trial court judges actually run on a party ticket, where they appear as Republicans or Democrats. But India has a very different system. Here, the only views whose expression should bar a person from becoming a judge should be those that undermine constitutional values or the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. In this sense the collegium is absolutely right to hold that the expression of political views, as part of the right to free speech, cannot disentitle candidates from becoming judges in India. But what has happened in the case of these two candidates is part of a larger GOI-collegium fight on judicial appointments. For instance, while the collegium keeps insisting that per the current MoP its reiteration of a name is binding on GOI, the latter has hardened its position against this convention. The lack of transparency and accountability of the collegium that had caused diverse political parties to cooperate on the NJAC constitutional amendment hasn’t seen much redress since SC quashed NJAC back in 2015 – even as dissonance with GOI has widened significantly. It is citizens and justice that are the real victims of this impasse. It must end. The Centre and SC must sit together to devise an institutional mechanism for smoother – and time bound –judicial appointments.",
        "Topic126":"In its eight-page reply to the Union sports ministry, the Wrestling Federation of India dismissed all allegations of sexual harassment as motivated by a ‘hidden agenda’.  The sweeping, simplistic and swift way in which it did so only confirmed what the wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar were spotlighting – that the federation silences every accusation against its domineering chief. At that point, the ministry finally asked Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to ‘step aside’. But this is only the start of a fair hearing to Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and the other much-medalled wrestlers who are speaking in public for those who cannot yet do so themselves. That these sexual harassment allegations are not yet in writing and that the victims haven’t yet stepped forward is quite understandable given the thick history of harassment complaints against male administrators and coaches that ended up with the complainant paying a bigger price. Both the sports ministry and IOA’s oversight committees for probing the allegations against Singh and WFI must therefore do their work not only with diligence, but also sensitivity. Women who have already suffered unjustly, must not be subjected to brute invasions of privacy. Deliver a timely verdict, initiate police action as warranted, and begin institutional fixes. Indian sports also need more women in positions of authority, including as coaches. Their presence is critical for budding female athletes, who shall be watching the two probes closely. Sexist nightmares can quickly wither a young woman’s dream of winning golden glory for her country.",
        "Topic127":"UK international trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has pointed out that the country left the EU precisely because it does not believe in the free movement of people. Consequently, visa liberalisation under the proposed India-UK FTA is not up for negotiation. But in that case, there’s not much left to negotiate. To begin with, in the ongoing FTA talks, the potential of enhanced trade through an India-UK deal is underwhelming. The two-way trade between India-UK in 2021-22 was $17.5 billion, lower than India’s trade with Germany or with Belgium. As a proportion of India’s overall merchandise trade, it was less than 2%. In such a scenario, the likelihood of freer movement of skilled labour and students between India and the UK could have provided an incentive to quicken the pace of negotiations. But given the UK’s domestic politics, visa liberalisation appears to be dead in the water. FTAs require tradeoffs. Some domestic interests have to be set aside in the pursuit of larger gains from lowering barriers to trade. Clearly, the UK government is reluctant to spend political capital on visa liberalisation, even if it makes economic sense. This makes tradeoffs harder to justify for India too. Even the UK’s own assessment doesn’t show eye-catching returns if this FTA is concluded. The UK government’s paper on FTA locates it within a larger strategy of strengthening trade ties in the Indo-Pacific region. Access to India’s huge market appears to be the UK’s primary incentive. An FTA which lowers tariffs for British exporters helps the UK. But with UK tariffs already low, what’s the potential big gain for India when freer movement of people is not on the cards? It’s not as if India hopes to get unique concessions. The UK and Australia already have a regime of unfettered movement for young people, including job seekers. Against this backdrop, GoI should double down on other potential FTAs like the ones with the EU and US. Likely gains from deepening trade ties with them are far greater than anything on offer by the UK.",
        "Topic128":"This year, for the first time, women make up 30% of the IIT-JEE applicant pool. This is entirely good news, because JEE results have long been grim advertisements for glaring gendered disparity. Girls routinely outperform boys in boards and medical entrance. That JEE has remained a hurdle was partly because many girls didn’t even try. The reasons for this gender gap are complex. It is not differences in innate ability or a lack of interest in scientific and technical education. Implicit biases and the lack of role models might be central to the scarcity of women in science in the West, but in India, women make up 43% of the STEM education pool, one of the highest ratios in the world. The government has made active interventions to spark girls’ interest in STEM study, and institutions are assessed for their gender inclusion. IITs have tried to mend the gap too – the horizontal ‘supernumerary’ quota gives women who have passed the JEE Advanced an edge in courses of their choice and has taken the presence of women to 20% on IIT campuses, a visible improvement. The reluctance to aim for the IITs, then, is not rooted in individual psyches as much as social constraints, and in the design of the high-stakes JEE. The exam, which usually involves years of intensive coaching in faraway locations, did not just filter out girls, it has also been skewed against students from rural and lower-income backgrounds. This year’s jump in candidates from OBC and EWS categories is also heartening on that front. If the IITs are to be a magnet for India’s brightest minds in science and tech, they must make sure that social disparities don’t come in the way of talent.",
        "Topic129":"Telangana this year will witness an odd Republic Day. A report in TOI said that the K Chandrashekar Rao government has asked Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to hold a separate function. That Telangana will have two separate official R-Day events is thanks to the very public acrimony between the political executive and the governor. It has also resulted in the stalling of at least eight bills, which are yet to receive the governor’s assent. Friction between the state government and the governor over withholding assent to bills cleared by the legislative assembly is also common to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Chhattisgarh. Republic Day’s significance stems from the adoption of the Constitution. It replaced the British Raj legislation where the governor functioned as an agent of the colonial power vested with greater authority than the elected council of ministers. The Constitution, however, gave primacy to the legislative assembly and the political executive. That did not prevent misuse of the office till a Supreme Court constitutional bench in 1994 reiterated the primacy of the legislature and narrowed the ground for dismissal of a government. The grey areas still allow a governor to make controversial calls on appointment of chief ministers. For instance, Maharashtra’s governor BS Koshyari, who recently stated that he wished to step down, swore in a short-lived government in 2019. The current phase of conflicts between governors and the political executive stems largely from stalling of bills. Article 200 of the Constitution details the options of a governor when a bill is cleared by the assembly. However, it does not unambiguously lay down a deadline. Given that the Constitution is clear that the legislature has primacy, it’s bad form for governors to use this loophole to stall. However, a highly competitive political system awash with animus is likely to frequently deviate from constitutional morality. Two fixes are needed. First, put a deadline on how long a governor can stall a bill. Second, make governors accountable to not just the central executive via the President but also the Rajya Sabha and the state government.",
        "Topic130":"Last October, 135 people died when Gujarat’s Morbi footbridge collapsed five days after its post-renovation reopening. Lapses in both the work done by the contractors and its municipal oversight were glaring even in those first horrifying days when victims were being taken out of the Machchhu river. Three months on, officials’ intransigence is perhaps even more glaring. Morbi municipality has refused to respond to the state government’s show-cause notice. This is not even a political turf war as seen in say, Delhi, when different parties have been running its state government and municipal bodies. In the Morbi municipality, all 52 councilors are from BJP. So where is their entitled pushback coming from? An obvious factor is the deeply entrenched absence of municipal accountability, which can be found nationwide. As for the contractors, while police have finally issued an arrest warrant against Oreva (Ajanta) promoter Jaysukh Patel, what is really indefensible is that they haven’t even been able to interrogate him in the intervening months. Yesterday, Ajanta admitted before Gujarat HC that ‘some wrong was committed’ by it and offered to pay compensation to victims. But neither the municipality nor the contractor should be allowed to stall and sidestep penalties due by law. A forensic examination in November itself had found that the cables of the bridge were rusted, anchors were broken, and bolts connecting the two were loose. It made clear that the bridge repair contract had been given and executed in a dangerous way. Given how much of India’s urban decay – from potholed roads to unsafe buildings and dying lakes – can be traced back to a nexus of corrupt municipal bodies and builders, righting it should begin with exemplary punishment in high-profile cases like the Morbi tragedy.",

The change was triggered by the Supreme Court setting January 26 as the deadline for Google to comply with the Competition Commission of India’s rulings. In the new model, smartphone makers can sidestep the bouquet and instead license individual apps from Google. Also, its search engine will not necessarily be the default setting. The regulatory crackdown here needs to be located in a global context. Google’s business model is under scrutiny in major economies. South Korea’s parliament in 2021 passed a bill imposing curbs on the proprietary billing system of Google and Apple. EU in May will enforce a new law, Digital Markets Act, which will prevent ‘gatekeepers’ from engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. It will no longer be business as usual for the Android OS ecosystem which runs more than 3 billion smartphones globally. How far will this regulatory pushback against Google change the OS landscape? It will surely chip away at Google’s dominance but a substantial change in the near future is unlikely. It’s because the walled garden approach that ensured Android’s dominance is based on a complex model of cross-subsidies. Google’s huge user base comes from offering free services such as a search engine and email. This user base is then monetised for advertising revenue. Even third party apps cannot all wish away Google. Application Programming Interfaces offered by Google allow app developers to utilise a number of its services. It reduces development costs for third party app developers. This web of cross-subsidies cannot be disentangled overnight. Yet, the regulatory crackdown on the Android ecosystem is necessary to open the door to more competition. It may not happen overnight but the process is underway. For regulators, the takeaway is that the digital world’s economies of scope require a new set of tools. Looking at existing market share makes little sense when an acquisition can change future market dynamics. Keep in mind, Android was acquired by Google.",
        "Topic132":"India has issued a notice of modification for the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, with good reason. IWT is one of the few major treaties between the two neighbours and has stood for more than 60 years. But since 2015, Pakistan has been trying to subvert it, including by persistently raising objections regarding India’s Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir. While the projects are on the Chenab and Jhelum, for which Pakistan has unrestricted use under IWT, the treaty also allows India to use these rivers in non-consumptive ways. In fact, Pakistan had taken its objections to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2010. But the court ruled that Kishenganga was a run-of-the-river project permitted under IWT. The same opinion was reiterated by the World Bank – also a party to IWT – in 2017. Nonetheless, Pakistan first unilaterally insisted on the appointment of a neutral expert and then switched to demanding a court of arbitration to adjudicate its objections, in contravention of IWT’s graded dispute settlement mechanism. At the heart of Pakistan’s objections is the fictitious claim that India is using river waters as a hybrid warfare tool. Plus, it complains that given India’s international standing, Pakistan can hardly expect a fair hearing from the international community. This kind of schizophrenic thinking is precisely the reason Pakistan finds itself in its present mess. Last year’s devastating floods, the burgeoning inflation and forex crises and the new terror wave launched by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan are all matters that Pakistan’s leadership ought to prioritise. Yet, Pakistan’s deep-state remains fixated with India and Kashmir. New Delhi’s IWT notice gives Islamabad 90 days to enter intergovernmental negotiations to rectify the breach of the treaty. This issue needs to be resolved in a bilateral format.",
        "Topic133":"India is finally ramping up infrastructure development across LAC. China’s lead on this has had a clear bearing on the mobility of India’s troops in the region. And since Galwan in 2020, there has been an extra urgency to bridge the gap. So, India’s construction of a 135 km road connecting Chushul and Demchok in eastern Ladakh should be one among other projects in that strategically important area and BRO must meet the two-year construction deadline. That said, given the sensitive ecology of Ladakh, GoI also needs to be extra careful about the construction of this and other projects. Activists from the region have been pointing out that unsustainable construction, industries and tourism can bring catastrophic consequences to the fragile zone. Studies by Kashmir University and other organizations show that glaciers in the Leh-Ladakh region will deplete by two-thirds unless conservation efforts are stepped up. These glaciers are already melting faster than expected due to construction of highways and human activities. Add to this government’s amendments to the Environment Impact Assessment Rules last year that exempt highway projects of strategic and defence importance that are 100 km from the borders from obtaining environmental clearance. This rightly raises concerns about the damage being done to sensitive ecosystems. The recent land subsidence disaster in Uttarakhand’s Joshimath provides ample proof that we have failed to take care of our mountain ecology. From Northeast to Himachal, India’s mountain ranges are under pressure, and many voices have started asking whether every road, bridge, train line planned really needs to be built. It is nobody’s argument that defense shouldn’t be prioritised. But strict protocols need to be worked out to ensure even strategic projects in sensitive regions have the least impact on the environment. Ultimately, ecological disasters will also jeopardise strategic objectives. Case in point, the Joshimath crisis forced our troops stationed in the area to move to a different location. Therefore, infrastructure construction along LAC needs to be carefully planned and executed, not just for environment but to ensure the projects’ own longevity.",
        "Topic134":"The Bharat Jodo Yatra wrapped up with Rahul Gandhi unfurling the Tricolour at Srinagar’s Lal Chowk, but it’s hard to judge exactly how much political mileage he has gained in traversing 14 states over the past five months. Public attention definitely gained momentum along the way – whether captured by the white T-shirt and the new beard, or him walking more than 20 km a day, listening to umpteen men, women and children, sharing a warm hug with many, giving several press interviews, or the spirited anti-BJPism and the signature ‘mohabbat ki dukan’ speeches. But this period also saw Congress shrinking humiliatingly in Gujarat and even its Himachal respite from 18 losses was too close for comfort. The yatra has showcased Congress’s organizational skills, both on the ground and in social media. The outreach has branded Rahul with empathetic and collegial gravitas. But so far there is no evidence that this increased ‘soft power’ of his likeability is matched by increased ‘hard power’ to win votes. That will be tested in the nine state elections lined up this year ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The results will clarify whether the yatra has been just a vanity project of the Gandhi family or whether it has spurred a long-awaited revival of Congress. The party has to hold on to Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the only two states where it is in government other than Himachal; take advantage of the anti-incumbency in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh; fight oblivion in Telangana. This means that the patchwork of citizen discontents that have gotten a sympathetic hearing in the yatra now needs to be woven into tight poll campaigns. Perhaps BJP’s most wounding criticism of the yatra has been that it is ‘directionless’. Rahul and Mallikarjun Kharge have their work cut out to disprove this. And that’s something the other opposition parties will also be watching closely ahead of 2024 – 21 of them have been invited to attend a concluding rally of the yatra in Srinagar today. The walk is done but the work just begun.",
        "Topic135":"The draft UGC regulations for setting up campuses of foreign higher educational institutions are first of all a reminder of the snail’s pace at which this reform has been moving, one government to another. When a bill to this end was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 1995, liberalization had just begun feeding Indian students’ appetite for a world-class education. As knowledge of the opportunity gains of such an experience has spread across the country, the longing for it has grown manifold. So second, the question is how the new draft regulations are different from the oft-repeated, failed and fuzzy promises of bringing Yale or Harvard to India. The only ‘infrastructure’ reference in the regulations is that ‘institutions should arrange for adequate physical infrastructure.’ This is in sharp contrast to how foreign university campuses in China and the Gulf countries have been facilitated by a lot of funding and public works by the host country. Perhaps the most notable advance is to allow the foreign institutions ‘repatriation’ per the Fema rules – hitherto the disallowance of for-profit education in India has been a deal-breaking disincentive. Also welcome is the concession of autonomy to these institutions in recruiting faculty and staff from India and abroad – whether it be qualifications, salary structure or other conditions of service. But by simple logic, whatever is a necessary condition of excellence for a foreign institution must also be so for a domestic one. If the regulator has accepted how much educational gains are tied to universities’ financial and academic autonomy, it seems quite self-defeating to deny this autonomy to the thousand universities that are educating Indian youth today but promise it to a select few who may do this tomorrow.",
        "Topic136":"A good percentage of our time is spent on roads, and our roads just don’t get better or safer. A third of the 4.1 lakh documented road accidents in 2021 resulted in 1.5 lakh deaths. Another third of the accidents resulted in grievous injuries. Nearly everyone has a scary story about a close shave on the road. Recent incidents like the heart-wrenching Anjali Singh case in Delhi, cricketer Rishabh Pant’s accident in Uttarakhand, and Tamil Nadu software engineer S Shobana’s death, mowed down by a truck after her two-wheeler was felled by a pothole, highlight the multiple dimensions of risks while on the road. The record-setting expansion of the road network is a positive development. But the ecosystem that facilitates safe travel has lagged far behind. Building infra isn’t the end; new structures manned by old ways of doing things aren’t helping. Anjali was dragged by a car at night for over 12 kilometres with an eyewitness making calls to cops multiple times in vain. The poor state of policing on national capital roads stood exposed. The car’s drunk driver had no driving license but had nothing to fear on unpoliced roads. Not surprisingly, cities like Delhi, where crimes against women are frequent and street-lighting uneven, have few women two-wheeler drivers, unlike most southern cities. Women motorists and pedestrians will also feel much safer in better-lit roads, which enable improved road visibility. Agencies like NHAI and state public works departments, which construct and maintain major roads, must also be held to task for poor road conditions like potholes, inadequate signage’s and unscientific road construction. Official records blame over speeding and dangerous driving as responsible for most accidents, and non-wearing of safety equipment like helmets and seatbelts for most deaths. This implies that road safety enforcement must get better. The Motor Vehicles Act as amended in 2019 had empowered state governments to conduct electronic monitoring of roads through speed cameras, CCTV cameras, speed guns, body wearable cameras etc. Investments in such tech upgrades should happen faster. Equally important is incentivizing public participation in taking victims to hospitals promptly and reimbursing hospitals for emergency trauma care. From policing to courts to transport department to public works to healthcare, a ‘whole of government’ approach can make citizens safer. Such improvements will represent the next generation of governance reforms that India must target.",
        "Topic137":"A law ministry presentation that showed 79% of high court judges appointed between 2018 and 2022 were upper castes is unsurprising, but also unacceptable. Minorities, SCs and STs comprise 20%, 16% and 8% respectively of the population, but only 2.6%, 2.8% and 1.3%, respectively, of judges appointed post-2018 were from these groups. OBCs too are underrepresented, and women, nearly 50% of the population, made up just 13% of HC judges. In November, CJI Chandrachud had said that today’s HC judge composition reflects the situation of 30 years ago. By all accounts, there is tremendous diversity in higher education today. All India Survey of Higher Education reveals 53 women per 100 men in LLB courses in 2019-20 from just 44 in 2015-16. Similarly, SCs made up 13% of all LLB enrolment and OBCs 29%, suggesting that the old order has irrevocably changed. One of the many criticisms of the collegium system has stemmed from its indifference to the changing social composition in public institutions. Higher judiciary mirrors private entities – mainstream media is no exception – in not being representative enough. The collegium’s alleged penchant for nepotism, with many of those passing muster being sons, a few daughters, and kin of ex-judges, is seen as blocking the way for ‘unpedigreed’ others. The now-quashed six-member NJAC was to have one of the two eminent members from SC, ST, OBC, women or minorities. And in another blow against diversity, GoI has not cleared the appointment of India’s first gay judge. Diversity brings collective experiences and point of views for the Bench from traditionally non-elitist groups, improving quality of justice delivery, and representation inspires social confidence. CJI Chandrachud should walk the talk and prod the Supreme Court and HC collegiums into actively looking for diversity in appointments.",
        "Topic138":"The emergency evacuation of residents from parts of Joshimath should serve as a national wake-up call. The town’s land subsidence problem featured in government reports over four decades ago. But that wisdom got bulldozed by infrastructure and construction plans designed for the region. The repeated economic and human loss experienced in the Garhwal Himalaya over the last few years should finally spur India to factor environmental consequences in its calculation of project benefits and in GDP. It will present a more realistic picture of where we stand. The overarching case for estimating green GDP, which accounts for environmental degradation, is the risk faced by India on account of climate change. India ranked fifth in the Global Climate Risk Index in 2020, which makes the country among the more vulnerable nations. Since then, India has committed to a nationally declared emission target of net zero by 2070. It’s a quantitative measure and the milestones on the path of its realization need to be measured. Here, our performance is poor. A recent study in the RBI Bulletin pointed out that data on environment indicators are unavailable in any Indian database. Researchers are forced to rely on data generated overseas in an area where India is acutely vulnerable. The situation is retrievable. Accounting for environmental degradation allows for calibration of policy and a sharper focus on relevant technology. Consider the example given by US economist William Nordhaus. He estimated that between 1973 and 2018, growth rate of net national product after adjusting for environmental costs is actually marginally higher than the unadjusted NNP. The reason is that over time emissions have declined relative to output and costs of producing an additional unit keep going down. That’s the case in India too, which is a cause for hope. The RBI study said that each unit of GDP in 2000 consumed 4.5 kg of material. By 2017, it had come down to 2.8 kg per unit of GDP. The trend will continue. The environmental risk in India varies across regions. Estimating green GDP at both national and state levels will hold a mirror to policy makers on the potential costs and benefits of economic decisions. The first step is to build our own database. It needs to be followed by dissemination of green GDP to inform policy at levels of government.",
        "Topic139":"In scenes reminiscent of the 2021 US Capitol riots, Brazilian supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro recently stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Bolsonaro is known as the Trump of the Tropics. Like Trumpers, Bolsonaro supporters have long been fed conspiracy theories and untruths by their leader and his allies. That they would undertake a course of action similar to their American ideological brethren shouldn’t surprise many. After all, it is clear that the new right-wing in many democracies is galvanized by personality cults and emotional appeal with facts and critical thinking taking a backseat. This has allowed leaders of this new brand of politics – driven mostly by social media echo chambers – to frame elections as merely a tool to obtain power. Democratic values are loosely adhered to and sometimes even abandoned. Thus, when elections don’t go their way, the default action is to discredit the results and frame the winning side as corrupt thieves. Needless to say this undermines democratic processes and viciously divides democratic societies. The only winners then are autocratic regimes like China that want to overthrow the global democratic order to climb to the top of the global hierarchy themselves. Notably, not only are political freedoms absent in China, authorities there also tightly control social media. Thus, it is high time democracies recognize this threat to them from autocratic regimes. Deep political-social divisions in democratic nations are precisely what countries like China want. Therefore, all shades of political opinion in democratic nations must respect democratic norms and processes, and not allow political rivalry to descend to social anarchy. It is welcome that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed concern about the riots in Brazil and emphasized that democratic traditions must be respected. Everyone should pay heed to his message.",
        "Topic140":"Data from Wetlands International shows India has lost nearly two of five wetlands in the last 30 years, while 40% of them can’t support aquatic animals. Most of this degradation is thanks to usual culprits – unplanned infrastructure, pollution, over-exploitation, reclamation. Given that wetlands are vitally important for water storage and aquifer recharge and play the role of storm buffers and flood mitigators, their erosion is bad news on several critical fronts. Wetlands are also natural carbon sinks, making them crucial for combating climate change. A total of 75 Indian wetlands with a surface area of over a million hectares are designated as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, which India ratified in 1982. But even the largest among them, the Sundarbans wetland, has lost around 25% of its mangroves due to erosion over the past three decades. One of the main culprits for this is reduction in sediments due to upstream dams. Similarly, encroachment and construction on urban wetlands like the Pallikaranai marsh in Chennai have made cities susceptible to flooding. In fact, Vadodara lost 30% of its wetlands between 2005 and 2018, while Hyderabad has lost 55% of its semi-aquatic bodies due to inefficient waste management and unchecked urban development. True, GOI has notified the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 to serve as a regulatory framework for conservation efforts. But most of the assistance provided by the Centre to states for conservation of wetlands is directed towards the notified Ramsar sites, ignoring urban wetlands. Unless greater awareness is created about the benefits of wetland conservation and urban planning actively incorporates preservation of these bodies – Delhi Master Plan 2041 is a good start – the situation will worsen. Wetlands are natural shock absorbers. We need that protection.",
        "Topic141":"Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked into yet another controversy when he walked out of the Tamil Nadu assembly – the ‘provocation’ being a treasury resolution critiquing his deviations from the text of the speech written by the government. These speeches are always a party-government pamphlet. And while there are a small number of precedents for governors objecting in such cases, Ravi’s action was still arguably over-the-top. Even less gubernatorial were his official Pongal invites that described him as ‘Governor of Thamizhagam’. Thamizhagam, Ravi’s sudden brainwave, is not the state’s official name. All this is however in the realm of theatrics. The really substantive issue is the governor sitting on bills passed by the legislature. Article 200 stipulates that a governor shall ‘declare’ that he/she is giving assent to a bill or withholding consent. Governors can forward a bill to the President for consideration or return a bill with a message suggesting changes. But if the house passes the bill again, the governor has to give assent. So, Ravi and governors like Kerala’s Arif Mohammad Khan and Chhattisgarh’s Anasuya Uikey, who are also keeping bills pending without ‘declaring’ their intent, are violating the constitutional spirit. While the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that legislative power of governors is extremely limited and that governors are bound by the aid and advice of the cabinet, there is constitutional and judicial silence on how long a governor can keep a bill pending. But no Constitution can be expected to provide answers for every scenario cropping up and holders of constitutional positions must perform their duties with responsibility, avoiding reckless confrontation. Anything allegedly unconstitutional in a law, like Tamil Nadu and Kerala’s attempts to remove the governor as chancellor of state universities or Chhattisgarh’s to provide 76% reservation, is for the judiciary to quash. The governor usurping the agency of the legislature and council of ministers and playing judge is simply not on. The breakdown of the governor-cabinet relationship in many opposition-ruled states is unfortunate. The governor is a key intermediary in the Centre-state relationship. The Constitution gives Parliament and the Union government the upper hand when laws of the state clash with those of the Centre. Maintaining this status quo doesn’t require governors to overplay their hand. Ravi, as ex-police and IB, must show more administrative wisdom.",
        "Topic142":"Polls in three Northeast states of Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland – likely in February/March, dates are yet to be declared by EC – are likely to be a serious test for BJP. In Tripura, cracks have appeared in the BJP state unit, which forced Biplab Deb to step down as CM. BJP’s relations with its tribal ally, IPFT, have not been problem-free. This has been compounded by the steady rise of Pradyot Kishore Deb Barma-led Tipra Motha, which demands a separate tribal state. CPM has announced its intention of forming an alliance that will potentially include both Congress and Tipra Motha. However, TMC, which too has been eyeing Tripura since its victory in the 2021 Bengal polls, is likely to undermine such opposition unity by contesting all 60 seats alone. The NPP-BJP alliance in Meghalaya seems to be under strain with CM Conrad Sangma indicating last year that his party was willing to fight the polls without an ally. There are also Sangma’s reservations about a Uniform Civil Code in a tribal state. Then there is the festering interstate border dispute with neighboring BJP-governed Assam. The Assam Police firing incident in November that killed six people further chilled ties between the coalition partners. In fact, similar border and territorial issues also plague Nagaland and Assam. Additionally, the Nagaland governing coalition comprising Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party, BJP and Naga People’s Front has to navigate the demand by the Eastern Nagaland People’s Organization for a separate state of Frontier Nagaland. This comes on top of the existing impasse between the Centre and the NSCN-IM over the Naga peace talks with the latter insisting on a separate flag and constitution for the Nagas. Taken together, the three Northeast states present very complicated challenges for BJP.",
        "Topic144":"The Supreme Court has asked pertinent questions on GoI’s curative writ petition against the 1989 settlement order directing Union Carbide Corporation to pay $470 million (nearly Rs 750 crore) as damages for the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy. UCC was willing to cough up $426 million while GoI submitted that any amount less than $500 million would not be reasonable, following which SC settled on a midway figure of $470 million that both UCC and GoI agreed upon. The settlement was panned for short-changing the victims, for being inadequate for environmental repairs and as an ineffective financial deterrent against gross negligence. After failing to extract a higher compensation then, GoI is now seeking over Rs 7,000 crore in additional damages. The belated demand is unlikely to yield a positive outcome in most jurisdictions. Raising victims’ hopes for more compensation arguably places a moral responsibility on GoI to do more for them even if the judicial recourse falters. SC noted that Rs 50 crore from the original compensation still remains unutilized, a damning indictment of successive governments. SC rightly pointed out that vitiating a settlement after over three decades could damage India’s investment climate. Normally, SC’s gratuitous advice to government in the policy turf would seem completely uncalled for, but here it makes eminent sense. In fact, the court could have been lobbing the ball back to the Centre. SC also minced no words when it suggested that populism could be behind the belated curative writ petition, observing that it cannot be the basis for a judicial review. Having messed up in Bhopal, India has a responsibility to prevent more Bhopals from happening. A comprehensive legislation that helps in promptly and accurately fixing civil liability for negligent conduct is our best bet. Without this, courts are arbitrarily deciding compensation. While SC reduced the compensation decreed by Delhi high court to be paid by the Ansal brothers in the Uphaar fire tragedy, it set aside a Madras HC order that closed the Sterlite copper plant in Tuticorin but ordered the company to deposit Rs 100 crore with the district administration as pollution damages. This novel calculation of Rs 100 crore was around 10% of the company’s profit before tax between 1997 and 2012. A 2018 RTI reply showed that just 7% of the damages were utilized. Instead of aphorism by government and judiciary, it is time for firmness and predictability. ",
        "Topic145":"The production license of Noida-based drug firm Marion Biotech was suspended yesterday after the WHO edict that two cough syrups made by the company should not be used for children. This is welcome as the test results of the controversial syrups are awaited. Embryonal and DOK-1 Max were found to contain toxic ethylene glycol and were linked to 19 children deaths in Uzbekistan. This comes after a similar tragedy in the Gambia where the deaths of 70 children were linked to the consumption of four contaminated syrups made by Haryana-based Maiden pharmaceuticals. In both cases the culprit appears to be poor manufacturing of solvents used in the medicines. Yes, these appear to be extreme cases in the sense that these products were not sold in India. And that medicines manufactured for use in India generally meet adequate standards, although the problem of fake or less-than-ideally-effective pills persists. It is also the case that medicines manufactured for export to rich countries are made according to the specifications of the importing country. But more needs to be done to tackle manufacturing/regulatory infirmity and help India win the perception battle. Let’s remember that in as sensitive a product as medicines, global perception is important for India’s export-attuned pharma industry. GoI on its own must undertake a thorough and transparent inquiry focused on the supply chain – from vendors of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the manufacturing process to regulatory processes. It’s not as if there haven’t been controversies about pharma manufacturing standards in India, or that some plants’ processes haven’t been found less-than-ideal, or that questions haven’t been raised about regulation, including by a parliamentary standing committee. India deserves the tag ‘pharmacy of the world’ but with that global recognition comes the responsibility of ensuring the strictest standards for products that can literally make a difference between life and death.",
        "Topic146":"In April 1973, a 13-judge bench of the Supreme Court in a 7:6 majority delivered the institution’s most consequential verdict. Known as the Kesavananda Bharati case, it declared that Parliament’s right to amend the Constitution is not unfettered. An amendment cannot violate the Constitution’s basic structure or fundamental architecture. The aftereffects still reverberate. On January 11, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar in a speech questioned the basic structure doctrine. He said that the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and legislate is not subject to any other authority. In short, primacy of Parliament is inviolable. The basic structure doctrine arose out of the working of the Constitution over two decades. The relevant article, 368, doesn’t clearly spell out the scope of Parliament’s amending power. At first, SC held that Parliament has unfettered power. Subsequent cases saw the emergence of dissenting views (Sajjan Singh vs State of Punjab) and in the Golak Nath case, the majority in an 11-judge bench held that fundamental rights cannot be abridged. Finally, in 1973 came the basic structure doctrine. It was not a bolt from the blue or usurpation of the powers of Parliament. Instead, it reflected the maturation of a democracy. Take away the basic structure doctrine, the legislature could conceivably knock down the checks and balances that come through the separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary. That would go against the tenor of the constituent assembly debates that had creation of a robust democracy as the main goal. Dhankhar identified SC’s 4:1 verdict in 2015, which invoked the basic structure doctrine to strike down NJAC, as an example of incorrect usage. This paper disagreed with that verdict and shares many of politicians’ critiques of the judiciary. However, that doesn’t make a case against the basic structure doctrine. Instead, it points to a need for the judiciary to tighten it. The problem is that SC often interprets the basic structure doctrine loosely. This opens the door to the judiciary to stray into domains of the legislature and executive. And that creates enormous problems. But just as an ill-conceived law does not undermine the primacy of the legislature in making them, problematic judicial verdicts do not make a case against the basic structure doctrine. Many aspects of judicial functioning need change. The basic structure doctrine is not one of them.",
        "Topic147":"In another indictment of China’s Covid policy, the WHO has again said that Beijing needs to share more data on its Covid outbreak and that it still believes Chinese authorities are underreporting Covid deaths. In fact, given this scenario the global health body has said that it understands the decision of certain countries to take a precautionary approach towards Chinese travelers and demand Covid-negative tests from them. For, China reporting just 37 Covid-related deaths since last month is downright ridiculous. This contradicts ground reports of Chinese hospitals being overwhelmed and funeral homes working overtime. Taken together, China’s handling of Covid has been highly irresponsible since Day 1. It initially did not share adequate information about the virus and then went into one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. It then stonewalled efforts to investigate the origin of the novel virus and accused other nations demanding enquiry of prejudice. In fact, even after the rest of the world moved to a strategy of living with the virus, China persisted with zero-Covid despite the scientific evidence at hand. Then finally when protests broke out across China against the strict zero-Covid measures, Beijing abruptly lifted the restrictions. The entire trajectory of China’s Covid policy shows it was driven by political considerations, not scientific rationale. And now Beijing is again endangering the world by suddenly opening up, not sharing adequate Covid data and underreporting Covid deaths. This is what happens in a party-state system where all opposition is quelled and independence of institutions is not allowed. China’s handling of Covid is a lesson in why the world should not trust the country. It simply won’t play by international rules and cannot be counted upon as a reliable global player.",
        "Topic148":"The Delhi high court has ruled that central armed police forces (CAPF) will be entitled to the old pension scheme (OPS), which provides a guaranteed payout following retirement. HC cited Constitution’s Article 246 to conclude that CAPF personnel fall under the definition of armed forces and, thereby, are eligible for guaranteed pensions. The background to the judgment is that central government personnel who joined in January 2004 onwards are not eligible for OPS. Instead, they are grouped under the national pension scheme (NPS), which functions on the lines of EPF. There are no guaranteed payouts in NPS and the benefits that accrue to pensioners depend on the returns generated by their investments. HC’s ruling is inconsistent with reality. A GoI written response in Parliament said that CAPF personnel who joined since January 2004 have been part of NPS. It’s a situation where bureaucratic sloppiness in drafting notifications has led to a judicial verdict at odds with reality. GoI needs to appeal and get matters sorted. Separately, it’s important that Parliament has a discussion on the perils of reckless promises on reversion to OPS. It took a rare moment of unanimity among major political parties to shift to NPS, and its implementation spanned two governments. It’s not just GoI, most states voluntarily shifted to NPS because OPS is fiscally unsustainable. Therefore, Himachal Pradesh government’s decision to revert to OPS will undermine the state’s fiscal position and cut into other development spending. GoI, which sets annual borrowing limits for states, needs to deal with this issue at a political level. Many richer countries find themselves in a fiscal straitjacket on account of crushing pension burdens. India’s transition to NPS happened at the right time and it’s now important to stick to it.",
        "Topic149":"Britain has said that it will supply Ukraine with tanks – another surefire way to intensify the conflict this spring. Kyiv’s Western allies had so far held off on supplying West-made main battle tanks. Now, Finland and Poland are set to join Britain by supplying Ukraine with German-made Leopard tanks, provided Berlin agrees. And US secretary of defense Llyod Austin is hosting allied defense chiefs this week, a meeting expected to see major new announcements of weapons for Ukraine. Yes, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is unconscionable. But Kyiv’s Western backers seem to be loving the war, instead of working for peace. Europe, and the world, will of course suffer more economically if the war gets nastier. Large parts of Europe are already facing negative or little economic growth, while the IMF has forecast another tough year for the global economy. And Europe’s determination to wean itself off Russian energy is hurting many parts of the Global South as fuel supplies get diverted, also pushing up prices. Plus, it’s telling that the US has been by far the largest supplier of military weapons to Ukraine, providing €18.5 billion worth of equipment till November 20, 2022 (data from Kiel Institute for World Economy). This means billions of dollars of fresh contracts for American arms makers to replenish stockpiles. With the US already accounting for 40% of the world’s weapons exports and its Congress approving a huge $858 billion defense budget for this year, which includes specific provisions for Ukraine, the American defense industry is probably loving the war most. One should read this in the context of unhelpful rhetoric from the US and its allies that Russia must lose this war. The plain fact is this conflict won’t end well if the aim is to humiliate Putin. Backed to a corner, he may respond in the worst ways. The West’s focus ought to be on getting to a stage where peace negotiations are possible. It should work with India and China on this. Tanks for Ukraine won’t bring peace in Ukraine.",
        "Topic150":"The National Disaster Management Authority has instructed government institutions and officials to avoid interacting with media or share information on social media about land subsidence in Joshimath. The gag order will be in force till the final report of NDMA’s expert group is submitted. The immediate trigger for the gag order appears to be a satellite report of ISRO that indicates subsidence of about 9 cm in seven months. NDMA should rethink its decision – a gag order won’t stop the flow of bad news, if that’s NDMA’s motive, but it may affect intelligent opinion-building that needs a free flow of authentic information. The situation in the region is evolving, with cracks in both the ground and buildings being reported daily. Public speculation on probable causes and on fresh incidents of land subsidence is inevitable. The information vacuum left by the government will be filled by sources that may often be dubious. Granted, NDMA’s expert committee’s conclusion will come after a thorough examination of the situation. However, with Joshimath residents’ anxieties running high, periodic communication by scientific bodies is necessary. Also, satellite pictures of the region are not limited to Isro’s, and plenty of foreign scientists are working on the Joshimath subsidence. Global experience of Covid hammered home the lesson that scientific collaboration is the best way to diagnose a problem and find a solution. Stringent restrictions on the information flow is self-defeating. Governments at all levels in India need to encourage their institutions to collaborate with scientists in the private sector and in foreign institutions. A bigger pool of experts analyzing a subject is more likely to come up with useful insights. NDMA’s gag order is the second such sarkari instance in the recent past. A few weeks back ICAR issued a similar one for GM mustard. Debates and disagreements are intrinsic to science. They expand the boundaries of knowledge. Official attempts to curb information and debate trigger suspicion. In addition, a culture of doing-little also delays recognition of problems. Joshimath’s land subsidence, which even official studies noted decades ago, is an example.",
        "Topic151": "Union law minister Kiren Rijiju’s letter to CJI DY Chandrachud seeking representation for GoI in the collegium, and consultations with states, signals another front being opened in the Centre-Supreme Court standoff. The collegium system is the outcome of the Third Judges Case of 1998, which envisioned procedures for appointment of SC and high court judges. Subsequently, a Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) was finalized following consultations between the Centre and SC. The only way GoI’s new proposal can be implemented is if SC agrees to revisit the Second and Third Judges Cases. But this is a bad idea: It is Parliament that must do the law-making. Making Parliament into a bystander while the executive proposes and the judiciary decides how to frame the law is bad form. This newspaper has argued for a National Judicial Appointments Commission and believes it deserves another chance. The constitution bench that scrapped NJAC did so without having the benefit of seeing it work. GoI, surprisingly, hasn’t made another attempt to re-enact NJAC. Perhaps, SC can be persuaded this time to watch NJAC at work before inevitable legal challenges to it are taken up. After all, such wait-and-watch has been the SC modus to challenges against demonetization, electoral bonds, Article 370, CAA, etc. An alternative course is to revise the MoP as directed by the five-judge NJAC bench in a subsequent order. This order laid special emphasis on making the collegium more transparent through appropriate revisions to the MoP through recording minutes of collegium discussions including dissension, setting up secretariats for each HC and SC for better management of the process, clear eligibility criteria for appointment to HCs and SC, and a mechanism to deal with complaints against judgeship candidates. Since Centre’s primary concern about the present collegium system appears to be the lack of transparency, the MoP revision, which has stalled for over six years over relatively minor disagreements, should be revived. The current standoff is creating unnecessary tensions, and mustn’t affect filling of judges’ vacancies. May wise judgment prevail.",
        "Topic152": "Nirmala Sitharaman recently said that she is from the middle class and therefore identifies with it. With her fifth budget speech scheduled on February 1, she pointed out that GoI had not levied new taxes on the middle class. Instead, it prioritized urban infrastructure such as metro projects. Given India’s narrow income tax base, middle class aspirations and anxieties often come into focus ahead of the budget. How large is the constituency? Thinktank PRICE pegs middle class households as ones that earn an income of Rs 5-30 lakh a year. PRICE estimated they make up 30% of all households in 2020-21. That’s roughly in line with what tax data shows. In 2018-19, on an admittedly narrow individual income tax base of about 56 million returns filed, individuals with income in the range of Rs 5-25 lakh numbered around 19 million, or 34%. The data on the tax base is out of sync with consumption patterns, which suggests that the potential size of the middle class is much larger. It leads to Sitharaman’s second observation about investments in public infrastructure. There’s a mismatch between what different levels of government show as investment and public perceptions about their quality of life. Plenty of anecdotal evidence suggests that an increasing proportion of the middle class rely on private provision of basic services such as transport, healthcare and education. This trend leads back to questions about the tax base as economist Devesh Kapur suggests that when middle classes ‘exit’ and move towards private provision of basic services, it has an adverse effect on the inclination to pay taxes. In a separate study on the middle class, Kapur and his co-authors tried to gauge the size of the middle class by asking people to self-identify. Almost half of India describes itself as middle class, a phenomenon that’s sharper in urban areas. Poor urban governance architecture not only limits the impact this class can have on politics, it also makes it harder for individuals to cross the Rs 5 lakh income threshold. The middle, which benefitted from liberalization, needs to grow faster.",
        "Topic153": "Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif’s statement that after having fought three wars with India his country had learnt its lesson and now wanted peace with its neighbour is half desperation and half humbug. Sharif called for ‘honest’ talks with the Indian leadership on so-called ‘burning issues’ like Kashmir. He needs to be reminded that there is nothing to talk vis-à-vis Kashmir. Kashmir was always integral to the Indian Union and its status was further clarified by the revocation of Article 370, which again was purely India’s internal matter. The only good Pakistan can do with respect to Kashmir is this: Its military-intelligence complex stops sending terrorists and dismantles Pakistan-based terror launch pads. But the truth is this is simply not within Sharif’s powers. And the generals can’t give it up because the so-called Kashmir issue has made the careers of many in Rawalpindi GHQ. Sharif should concentrate on trying to fix Pakistan’s own, deepening problems rather than chase grand talks with New Delhi. Pakistan’s economy is a basket case. As of January 6, forex reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan plunged to $4.34 billion, just enough to cover three weeks of imports. Things have been further exacerbated by the devastating floods last year that drenched one-third of the country, displaced 8 million people, and dealt a body-blow to its agriculture sector. Meanwhile, inflation is forecast to stay between a whopping 21-23% with severe shortages of essentials like flour and fuel. True, some of Pakistan’s donors like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China have pledged further support. But a large chunk of this will materialize over three to five years. Add to this the spike in terror attacks by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan across the country and Islamabad’s deteriorating relations with the Afghan Taliban. Perhaps it is precisely because Islamabad is facing heat along the Durand Line that Sharif is offering an olive branch to his eastern neighbor. India is ignoring this and should continue to do so.",
        "Topic154": "BJP president JP Nadda has set his party a tough challenge of winning all nine state elections this year. Such a sweep would demoralize the opposition even before campaigning for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls begin. Also in BJP’s sights are 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where it anticipates tough fights. Such long-range planning is rare in Indian politics. Which is why BJP has become an election-winning machine. Nadda’s focus on sweeping assembly polls is understandable. BJP is yet to dominate state assemblies like it does in national politics, where there’s no rival to PM Modi in popularity or to BJP in resources, social engineering and narrative setting. BJP clearly hasn’t ruled out the possibility of developments in state politics crystallizing into a national opposition unity project. So, it makes eminent sense for the party to project invincibility at both central and state levels. But Nadda’s difficulty is that not all its state units are like their counterparts in Gujarat and UP, where factionalism has been completely stomped out. This is one reason BJP couldn’t replicate its impressive Gujarat showing in Himachal. In Karnataka, the switch from BS Yediyurappa to Basavaraj Bommai hasn’t reduced internal bickering. In Rajasthan and MP, factional fault lines could soon emerge. Another worry for BJP is that Congress leadership appears prepared to give a tough fight in at least three states – Karnataka, MP and Chhattisgarh. TRS, now BRS, in Telangana is a strong incumbent and the CPM-Congress alliance in Tripura could make the going tough for BJP. BJP’s other difficulty is ultra-competitive welfarism. After its OPS gambit in Himachal, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, Congress has promised in Karnataka an Rs 2,000 monthly handout to women heads of households, a staggering annual exchequer outgo of Rs 36,000 crore. Depending on the extent of anti-incumbency, such sops may or may not get traction. BJP is betting big on four factors: Modi magic; sizable representation to OBCs, SCs and STs in government and organization; welfare service delivery; and India’s growing international clout. Even for a state election, these are attractive propositions for voters. These four factors also feed into a grand narrative that opposition politics seem unable to dent. BJP’s unceasing quest for victories is its biggest strength. Nadda’s 9-0 wager is based on that.",
        "Topic155": "India’s healthcare system yesterday went through a mock drill to cope with a scenario where Covid cases surge. It’s a sensible thing to do and fits with the test-track-treat-vaccinate-behavior package that represents India’s current Covid strategy. A day ahead of the mock drill, Karnataka became the first state to make masking mandatory in public places. However, this mandate is not accompanied by fines for violations. Simultaneously, the state government spelt out guidelines for the service industry in view of the rise in business expected this week on account of New Year celebrations. India’s strategy needs to be framed in the context of two key aspects. At present, while caution on behavior is warranted, tightening operating conditions for the service industry is not. India’s caseload per million people was 0.13 on December 26. On the same day, France and Germany had a caseload of 547.7 and 301.7 respectively. In absolute numbers, India’s 24-hour addition to the caseload on December 27 was 3,421. With these numbers there’s no case to issue executive orders squeezing the service sector that only in the recent past crossed its pre-Covid business level. It’s economically damaging to overreact. A speedy rollout of vaccination in the second half of 2021 was perhaps the most effective measure of the policy to combat the pandemic. However, the performance this year when it came to the booster dose has been disappointing on account of complacency all around. To illustrate, WHO data shows that India’s boosted 16.16 people for every 100, while the global average is 30.23. The lackluster performance on boosters is not on account of vaccine shortage. Bharat Biotech, which in November received regulatory clearance for its intranasal vaccine for both primary series and heterologous booster, observed recently that there’s a lack of demand for vaccines. With the intranasal vaccine priced at Rs 325/ dose for bulk procurement by governments and Rs 800/ dose in the private market, the Covid strategy should double down on persuading eligible people to get boosted. In addition, there’s a case to consider reinforcing protection for India’s frontline workers. The nature of a pandemic always calls for caution. That however does not mean that policy tilts towards overreaction. Measures such as yesterday’s mock drill, masking mandates and enhanced vaccination drive should be the priority. This approach will keep infections under check without derailing economic growth.",
        "Topic156": "Karnataka’s legislative assembly on Tuesday cleared a bill that aims to integrate transport management in Bengaluru under an authority which will be headed by the chief minister. The Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority hopes to bring a more cohesive approach to providing solutions to a city that has expanded fast. It remains to be seen if this move works. There are, however, a couple of takeaways relevant to the larger challenges facing urban governance in India. At the heart of urban dysfunction is the creation of turfs among multiple bodies that carry out different functions. Breaking down barriers then would require the head of an urban body such as a mayor to have both the legal and political authority to force a cohesive approach. However, despite the 1992 74th constitutional amendment that gave constitutional recognition to the third tier of governance, states have not delegated enough powers to urban bodies. Given the experience of three decades, it’s now unrealistic to expect that the situation will change with direct contests for the mayor’s post – real power resides in the office of the head of the state’s political executive. This makes Karnataka’s development a step in the right direction because it explicitly acknowledges political realities. To illustrate, Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai said many state and national highways merge into Bengaluru’s roads. Big cities across India are similarly situated. Therefore, a transport authority with representatives from GoI’s organizations such as NHAI can work only if the political weight of the CM’s office is charged with the responsibility of sorting out turf issues. Mayors can’t pull that off. States that have big cities should carefully watch how the Karnataka experiment goes. If navigating Bengaluru’s roads becomes a less stressful experience, there’s a model here.",
        "Topic157": "The deaths of a Russian businessman-politician – who was a known critic of Putin – and his friend in Odisha under mysterious circumstances should alert India’s intelligence and security apparatus. As of now, the politician’s death is being termed accidental, although the fact that the local police didn’t preserve the viscera after post-mortem, as is the SOP, has raised many questions. Let’s note that the chairman of Russia’s second largest oil company fell to his death from a hospital window in Moscow. He too had called for an end to Russia’s military operation. Suspicious deaths are of course as old as international intrigue and conflict. And that various intelligence agencies occasionally target individuals in other countries for what Americans call extreme rendition is known. The point is countries, at least major countries, try to raise the cost of such back operations by foreign agencies through superior counterintelligence. As India’s strategic profile increases and New Delhi is seen as a key player in hot-button geopolitical issues – from the Ukraine conflict to the Taiwan Strait tensions – there is a danger of foreign agents bringing their battles to this country. Recall that in 2012 a car with the wife of the Israeli defense attaché in India was attacked with a sticky bomb in Delhi. This was when Israel and Iran were reportedly targeting each other’s diplomats and scientists through covert operations on foreign soil. Or note recent reports that China has been setting up secret police stations in other countries to coerce or intimidate Chinese nationals there. This especially should deeply worry India. Apparently, more than 100 such overseas Chinese police stations have been established in countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, South Korea, Japan, Germany and the US among others. The same modus operandi could be used by Beijing in India too, not just to monitor Chinese nationals here but to also execute plans that may have bigger security implications for New Delhi. Since very little is in public domain about India’s intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities, we can only hope that given newer challenges, its counterintelligence is upgraded or will get upgraded. So far, India’s security apparatus has been largely geared towards fighting and preventing terrorism. But we may have to increasingly deal with far more sophisticated threats. Well-resourced, highly trained espiocrats are part of becoming a major power.",
        "Topic158":"Love or something like it rarely endures forever. Relationships frequently sour or end. And when they do, the heartbreak or the ‘blame’ on the two sides rarely weighs equally on the measuring scale. Today the Tunisha Sharma suicide case is seeing a high-decibel post-mortem of her relationship with Sheezan Khan. It is understandable that her family is trying to cope with loss and grief in myriad ways, including looking for its cause in whether her lover was ‘unfaithful’ to Tunisha or ‘broke up’ with her. The minute, repetitive, painful computation of who did how much injury is a routine aftermath of human relationships gone wrong. But what’s police got to do with it? It should not be a matter of criminal investigation whether or not lovers are faithful to each other. Like some of the news TV programmes some policemen might find salacious sport in going down these personal corridors. But as the Supreme Court said in its 2018 judgment decriminalizing adultery, the fundamental right of an individual to self-determination includes sexual self-determination, into which ‘real private realm’ police should not intrude. In the Tunisha case, this impulse is aided by ‘abetment to suicide’ continuing to be on the statute books as a non-bail able offence. The police, having blundered into such cases by filing an FIR with little thought, then grab every bit of information as justification, and most often an adult is put through the wringer, aided by lower courts happily granting extended custody without asking questions. The many instances in which all this blundering soon enough reveals itself as just a gratuitous abuse of privacy, should act as a disincentive to police. That it doesn’t says a lot about how police views its role vis-a-vis citizens.",
        "Topic159": "The last two months of 2022 brought India’s cyber vulnerabilities into sharp relief. In November, securities depository CDSL said it had detected malware in some machines and disconnected itself from the capital market. Later, AIIMS, New Delhi, found its services compromised. GoI told Parliament that five servers were affected due to improper network segmentation. These two incidents are examples of a larger challenge confronting India. CERT-In’s India Ransomware Report for the first half of 2022 said that there’s been a 51% year-on-year increase in ransomware incidents. A majority of attacks are on datacenters. Data has a unique quality, it’s non-rivalrous. Simply put, it can be used simultaneously by different people and not necessarily with consent of the data owner. It’s this quality that makes even temporary data loss deeply problematic. As India moves apace to a digital operating system for social and economic activities, loss of data or even temporary access to it have emerged as a public security challenge. This problem is global in nature. For example, last year Ireland was forced to shut down its public healthcare service for a while following a ransomware attack. Coping with this challenge starts with everyone following basic steps to safeguard their data. The most serious problems come from organized cyber-attacks on large data repositories and critical public infrastructure. The extent and scale of attacks on critical information infrastructure are in the realm of speculation as GoI told Parliament that revealing details is not in the interest of national security. Of no less importance is ring fencing data repositories from cyber-attacks. On the legislative side, there are two aspects that India’s forthcoming personal data protection bill needs to emphasize. Data breaches are inevitable. The extent of loss, however, can be limited if two principles are followed. Purpose limitation in collecting data by all regulated entities needs to be strictly enforced. Sweeping in more data than required on flimsy pretexts increases risks manifold. Highly sensitive data such as biometrics are collected by different government organizations who may not all have high standards of cyber security. Collection of biometrics needs to be limited. The other essential principle is narrowing down the discretion enjoyed by a regulator in choosing when to let potential victims know about data breaches. Given data’s non-rivalries quality, offering a regulator too much leeway protects a regulated entity at the expense of potential victims.",
        "Topic160": "The Election Commission’s decision to test the possibility of remote voting for migrant workers will deepen democracy. Sections of government personnel vote through postal ballots. Since Covid, this facility is available to elderly over 80. But extending voting rights to migrant workers involves far greater numbers and will be through a customized EVM machine that can reportedly cater to 72 constituencies. The 2016-17 Economic Survey tracked annual interstate travel to estimate 6 crore migrant workers between 2001 and 2011. Census 2011 enumerated 45.6 crore migrants, nearly 40% of India’s population. These are huge numbers, suggesting why a large chunk of India isn’t exercising voting rights. The 2020 Bihar and 2022 UP polls clearly point to disenfranchisement of migrant workers. Male electors outnumbered female electors by 40 lakh in Bihar but just 3 lakh more men voted than women, equating to male turnout of 55% and female 60%. Similarly, male electors outnumbered females by 1.1 crore in UP, but just 45 lakh more men voted than women (male turnout was 50%, female 62%). With land, kinship, and sentimental ties to their native state, asking migrants to transfer their vote to the location of work is a sub-par option. The ability to cast votes is key to getting one’s voice heard in the political process. Lack of opportunities triggers most migrations. The exodus of over 1 crore migrant workers during the Covid lockdown hardly became an electoral issue anywhere. With migrants getting to vote, candidates and big netas will have to court this demographic and address their concerns. EC must convince political parties to support this game-changing initiative.",
        "Topic161": "We meet some new year’s effervescently but 2023 has us feeling edgy, like too much is hanging in the balance and we shouldn’t jinx the silver linings. The Ukraine-Russia war was the big black swan event of 2022 and what tops the world’s wish list today is that both of them find a way to negotiate peace. The world’s health and wealth are also closely tied to how China manages its stop-start pandemic games. India has so far done a credible job of riding these geo-economics headwinds, from managing inflation to rerouting its energy supplies. But the work of returning to its potential growth path will become harder if global recession builds up. Besides this knotty economic driving, BJP is also looking at a full election calendar that will specially test its southward skills. New sops for Lingayats and Vokkaligas in Karnataka are indicative of how tough this prestige battle is. Congress’s tough task is to convert Bharat Jodo Yatra’s buzz into electoral successes. Rahul Gandhi must understand that power is not ‘poison’, it’s a necessity. 2023 will also test domestic resilience in India’s favorite sport – cricket. The aesthetic detachment with which Indians could enjoy the football World Cup won’t be available with the ODI World Cup, where the pain of not having won an ICC trophy since 2013 really needs healing. But in addition to resilience, there has to be nimbleness. Past three years are proof that the unexpected happens. If, say, El Nino hurts the monsoon, government and RBI will have to go back to the drawing board, for an even tougher tightrope walk. If Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan pushes Pakistan near implosion, our security will have to step up swiftly. And if the year turns out to be unexpectedly pleasant instead, that will be a welcome breather.",
        "Topic162": "Pakistan is confronted by a variant of its most successful export – terrorism. Over the last few months, terror outfits like the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Islamic State and the Gul Bahadur Group have carried out daring attacks. The two-day hostage crisis at a counterterrorism detention center in north-western Pakistan last month best tells the story. Two points are crucial here. First, it is clear that following Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan last year, terrorism in the Af-Pak region has received a fillip. Reports are coming in from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and even Russia that Afghanistan has once again become a regional terror hub hosting a plethora of extremist outfits. Pakistan, which had played a crucial role facilitating Taliban’s return to regain its so-called strategic depth in Afghanistan, is now facing a blowback from the same forces it had supported. This is because of Islamabad’s failed policy of distinguishing between good and bad Taliban. That the Afghan Taliban and their Pakistani counterparts share the same political goals was proved by the fact that TTP broke off negotiations with Islamabad on the point of the integration of Pakistan’s erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Neither of the Talibans recognize the Durand Line. Second, if TTP and its ilk are able to capture large swathes of Pakistani territory – like they did in the 2000s – then the Pakistani state itself could be in danger of collapse. For, this time Islamabad has to contend with both an economic crisis and the support that the terrorists are receiving from Afghanistan. That in turn raises serious security implications for India on its western border. With Pakistan also facing elections this year, it’s time that the international community takes the emerging Af-Pak problem seriously.",
        "Topic163": "In his avatar as a Bharat yatri – he doesn’t have to worry about Congress’s organizational challenges – Rahul Gandhi has put forward a new formulation for opposition unity. The fresh ingredient in this old idea of trying to unite against BJP’s dominance urges Congress to make other parties ‘comfortable’ and feel ‘respected’. Not long ago Rahul as Congress president had little patience for opposition parties, when his sole focus was Congress revival. The feeling was mutual as regional satraps too lost patience with Rahul’s on-again, off-again approach to politics. That the Bharat Jodo Yatra has given a measure of political respectability to Rahul is true. But his advice to his own party or the opposition betrays the kind of near-naivete that he has often been associated with. It’s easy for Rahul to tell his party to give up seats for opposition candidates – it’s Mallikarjun Kharge who will have to put this into practice. When Nehru-Gandhis can be defied by some Congress satraps, what chance does Kharge have? As for Rahul’s reminder to opposition parties that only Congress can offer a ‘central ideological framework’ against BJP, this kind of grand talk needs some electoral successes to sound convincing. Without electoral success, all talk of ideological framework is an abstraction that can’t stir voters. Even a welfare idea won’t gain traction without good ground-level organization. Congress decline has solidified perceptions among voters there’s no national alternative to BJP. So, Congress needs some big wins in this year’s elections in Karnataka, the Hindi heartland and four Northeast states to convince opposition parties and voters that it is a serious proposition in 2024. But his hope in opposition parties uniting against BJP’s politics has a fundamental contradiction. No regional party wants a big Congress revival. They have grown at Congress’s expense. This is why no opposition leader joins Rahul’s yatra, save for existing allies. Parties otherwise fighting to preserve turf banding together for opportunistic alliances is hardly the stuff of dramatic challenge. That won’t sway voters in a national election against Modi. Rahul may have changed his political approach, but the political situation he has to work with – both vis-à-vis his own party and other party chieftains – remains fundamentally the same as 2019. Rahul says he has spotted undercurrents of voter dissatisfaction. But it’s still advantage-BJP."
