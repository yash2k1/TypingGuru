    "Topic1": "If budget making is a complex task, interpreting the Union Budget can be hazardous given the amount of fine print that one has to pore over. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s fifth Budget, and the current Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s final full-fledged one before next year’s general election, ticks all the right boxes on the face of it. Inclusive development that ensures prosperity for all, especially the youth, women, farmers, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, a focus on infrastructure and investment that serves as a multiplier for growth and employment, policies to enable green or environmentally sustainable growth, the rationalisation of direct taxes, including a raft of concessions to the middle and salaried classes, and pensioners, and, most importantly, doing all this while staying the course on fiscal consolidation. Terming it the “first Budget in Amrit Kaal”, Ms. Sitharaman sounded the poll bugle by emphasising the ruling dispensation’s achievements since 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first assumed office. Per capita income, she said, had more than doubled to ₹1.97 lakh as a result of the economy’s growth to being the worlds fifth-largest and the government’s efforts to ensure a better quality of living for all. She also cited an increase in formalisation of the economy and the widespread adoption of digital technologies, especially in the payments sphere, as other significant achievements. With an eye on ‘India at 100’, the Budget proposals, Ms. Sitharaman said, were aimed at actualising a “technology-driven and knowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust financial sector”. Emphasising that the economic agenda for achieving this vision would, among other things, require a focus on giving a strong impetus to growth and job creation, the Minister laid out her Budget proposals that were heavy on this government’s trademark acronyms describing the various schemes, but relatively light on details. PM VIKAS or Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma Kaushal Samman, for instance, would for the first time offer traditional artisans and craftspeople, or Vishwakarmas, a package of assistance aimed at helping them improve the quality, scale and reach of their products, she said. Specifics, including a financial outlay and the likely mechanics of implementation, were, however, not spelt out. Similarly, a ‘Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes’ or ‘MISHTI’, aimed at undertaking mangrove plantation along the coastline and on salt pan lands leaves the funding to a “convergence between MGNREGS and a compensatory afforestation fund”. With the rural sector’s mainstay employment guarantee scheme, one that was introduced during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government’s term, itself increasingly being starved of budgetary support, it is hard to fathom how the new initiative to protect and regenerate the ecologically sensitive mangroves will be funded. The decrease in outlay comes at a time when the rural economy is still to regain vigour from the ravages of the pandemic, the fallout on incomes from the uneven distribution of last year’s monsoon rainfall, and the relatively greater impact of high food inflation on hinterland households. At a broader level, the Budget estimate for expenditure on rural development in 2023-24 is pegged at ₹2.38 lakh crore, a marginal 0.1 percentage point increase when measured as a proportion of overall expenditure at 5.3%, compared with the 5.2% in the previous Budget Estimate. When viewed against the revised estimate, the outlay is a good 0.6 percentage point lower. Food subsidy too has been sharply pared: at ₹1.97 lakh crore, it is almost 5% lower than the 2022-23 Budget estimate and a steep 31% down from the revised estimate. To be sure, the government’s resolve to stay the course on fiscal consolidation, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic had led it to spend more even as revenue receipts dipped amid the unprecedented economic contraction, left Ms. Sitharaman with little leeway on the expenditure front once she had decided that the government would concentrate its resources on increased public outlays on infrastructure and investment. Capital expenditure has been allocated ₹10 lakh crore, a 33% jump from this fiscal’s Budget estimate. If one adds the almost ₹3.7 lakh crore set aside for grants-in-aid to States for the creation of capital assets, the Minister’s laudable intent to apply the force multiplier of government capital spending as the primary lever to spur economic activity becomes clearly evident. With global demand uncertain this year on account of the slowdown in the developed economies, as the Economic Survey pertinently pointed out, India’s domestic market will necessarily have to serve as the economy’s bulwark. Ms. Sitharaman has also attempted to woo the middle class with a raft of changes in personal income tax that would, in combination with tweaks to customs duties, in total cost the government ₹ 37,000 crore in foregone direct tax revenue. Some of these changes are aimed at leaving more money in the hands of the salaried and pensioners, cash that the Budget planners hope would find its way back either as savings or increased spending on vital consumption. The biggest beneficiaries of the income-tax changes though are likely to be those in the highest income bracket, where the effective rate has been cut by 3.74 percentage points reinforcing a perception that this government bats for the affluent.",
    "Topic2": "Equity benchmarks the Sensex and the Nifty ended with healthy gains on February 8 as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not throw any negative surprise to the market by lifting policy repo rates on expected lines. Positive global cues, after less hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, also underpinned sentiment. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das announced a 25 bps hike in the policy repo rate to 6.50 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the central bank decided by a majority of four out of six members to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target range and there is no harm to the economic growth of the country. Back home, while the 25 bps hike was on expected lines, the Street was eager to get hints on a pause in the coming policy meet. But the RBI refrained from giving any clear signal on the trajectory of rate hikes. This, however, did not upset the market which seems to be taking comfort from the optimistic projection of growth and inflation by the central bank for the next financial year. RBI projected real GDP growth for 2023-24 at 6.4 percent while CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 percent for the same period. Sensex remained in the green throughout the session and ended 378 points, or 0.63 percent, higher at 60,663.79. Nifty50 closed the day at 17,871.70, up 150 points, or 0.85 percent. Mid and smallcaps also clocked healthy gains. The BSE Midcap index rose one percent while the Smallcap index ended 0.76 percent higher. The overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms rose to ₹268.6 lakh crore from ₹266 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors richer by ₹2.6 lakh crore in a single session. Crude oil prices rose for the third consecutive day amid easing concerns over Fed rate hikes. Brent crude traded over a percent higher near the $85 a barrel mark. The rupee jumped 20 paise to close at 82.49 per dollar amid gains in domestic equities and weakness in the dollar index. Top Nifty gainers: Shares of Adani Enterprises (up 23.13 percent), Adani Ports (up 9.01 percent) and HDFC Life Insurance Company (up 5.25 percent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Top Nifty losers: Shares of Larsen & Toubro (down 1.48 percent), Eicher Motors (down 1.43 percent) and Bharti Airtel (down 1.39 percent) ended as the top losers in the Nifty pack. All sectoral indices ended in green. Nifty Metal jumped 3.78 percent, ending as the top sectoral gainer. Nifty IT, Pharma and Healthcare indices ended over a percent higher each.  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services observed that bulls took charge of the markets as the RBI’s MPC meeting delivered a smaller rate hike in line with market expectations. Nair underscored that RBI has taken a more optimistic view on domestic growth by increasing the GDP forecast while cautiously keeping CPI inflation at 5.3 percent for FY24. Global markets traded with hope as investors digested Powell’s speech, which stated that disinflation had begun but pointed towards the possibility of further rate hikes in response to a stronger job market. Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking said with all the major events behind us, the performance of the global indices combined with earnings will dictate the trend ahead. ‘This rebound has certainly eased pressure but a decisive close above 17,900 in Nifty is critical for any sustained recovery. Meanwhile, we reiterate our preference for IT, FMCG and select banking and auto pack and suggest focusing on identifying opportunities from these sectors,’ said Mishra. As per Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) of Kotak Securities, the Nifty formed a bullish candle on daily charts which is broadly positive. However, 17,950 could be the next profit booking zone for the bulls. ‘As long as the index is trading above 17,750, the uptrend wave will continue. Above the same, the market could move up to 18,150. On the flip side, below 17,750, the uptrend would be vulnerable,’ said Chouhan.",
    "Topic3": "Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das announced a hike of 25 basis points (bps) in the repo rate to 6.50 percent on Wednesday after the three-day Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting concluded. The MPC of the central bank decided by a majority of four out of six members to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target range and there is no harm to the economic growth of the country. The governor's commentary on growth and inflation was optimistic. The RBI projected real GDP growth for 2023-24 at 6.4 percent while CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 percent for the same period. The market looked happy with the policy decision which was in line with expectations. However, market participants may be slightly concerned over the fact that the central bank did not give any signal on the pause of rate hikes. It is worth noting that the RBI still believes inflation could remain above the 5 percent range for the next year. There could be upward revisions in inflation prints in case of a poor monsoon next year or a surprise jump in crude oil prices. RBI understands that the country's economic growth is on a firm footing, so it wants to remain focused on its primary job - keeping inflation under check. Besides, it wants to keep enough space with it to cut rates in future when a need emerges. Despite no clear signal on pause in rate hikes, the market is not visibly disappointed. Sensex and Nifty traded over half a percent higher in afternoon trade. Focus now has shifted to earnings and macroeconomic developments. Should we change our investment strategy now? A pause in rate hikes may be away but the market has enough opportunities in sectors that have started witnessing the emergence of value. As growth remains in focus, infra-sector stocks look attractive for the long term. Also, investors can increase exposure to the defensive sectors, such as IT, pharma and FMCG. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, pointed out that in a rising and high interest rate cycle, investors need to have a cautious approach because growth and valuations will tend towards becoming modest. ‘India's GDP growth is expected to slow slightly in FY24, while its valuation remains higher than that of other emerging markets. Hence, the investors need to shun growth stocks and buy into defensives like FMCG, IT, pharma, and telecom,’ he said. ‘Adopt value buying as a strategy. Sector-wise, infra, capital goods, and manufacturing look good owing to stable growth opportunities and moderation in valuations. Small and midcap stocks are also appealing on a long-term basis due to a drop in valuation near to its long-term averages,’ said Nair. Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at Stoxbox, is of the view that with a pause in rate hikes still looking far away due to continued high inflation and weak global macros, it would be prudent for investors to stay away from highly leveraged companies going forward. Chowdhury said these companies would be the first ones to face the heat in a rising interest rate scenario along with some moderation in economic growth. ‘Market participants should prefer defensives in this market, with a close eye on the quality of the business,’ said Chowdhury.",      
    "Topic4": "From time to time, the world has been tormented with newly emerging F pandemics throughout the history. It was believed earlier that the intensity of destruction caused by such pandemics was largely on account of lack of better health facilities. But this current COVID-19 outbreak has proved that humans are still not completely able to fight pandemics caused by the deadly viruses. Pandemics have occurred even after high technological advancements in the healthcare infrastructure. The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported towards the end of 2019 in Wuhan, in Hubei province of China. Subsequently, it spread to other parts of the world. It was declared as a pandemic by the WHO on 11th March, 2020. Coronaviruses are large family of viruses that are common throughout the world and can cause respiratory illnesses in people and animals. There are several known coronaviruses that infect humans and animals. Human coronaviruses were first discovered in 1960. The coronaviruses that can infect humans are 2298 (Alpha Coronavirus), NL63 (Alpha Coronavirus), OC43 (Beta Coronavirus), HKU1 (Beta Coronavirus), MERS-CoV(Beta Coronavirus), SARS-CoV(Beta Coronavirus).  The new coronavirus, also known as Novel Coronavirus or SARS COV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus that has never been identified before. It is responsible for the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease that causes respiratory illnesses in humans. The new corona virus is zoonotic in nature, which means that it can spread easily from animals to humans. The people infected with COVID-19 disease due to the new coronavirus experience mild to moderate respiratory illnesses and recover without any special treatment. But the COVID-19 disease affects the older vulnerable people badly and those having other medical problems. People those having cardiovascular diseases; diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer etc. are more likely to develop serious illness. The COVID-19 disease spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread through the aerosol particles discharged from the mouth while speaking in closed spaces. The people who are infected with the COVID-19 disease can get either very low infection or very high infection. Those who have been infected with lower infection load may develop very mild symptoms or develop no symptoms at all. Those infected with higher infection load, develops severe symptoms which can also be life threatening. The virus seems to be easily spreading in the community and sustaining for longer periods in the community because of asymptomatic infections that are not easy to detect. In COVID-19 disease the common symptoms include-runny nose, fever, headache, cough, sore throats, red marks on the skin, loss of taste and smell, rashes, tiredness, diarrhoea etc. People having serious illness due to COVID-19 disease, are not able to breathe easily, may feel chest pain and pressure and may also have loss of speech or movement. There are no special cures for the COVID-19 disease. People who get infected by the disease are provided with symptomatic treatment that includes reducing fever and treating the respiratory system with common interventions. To prevent infection and slow down its transmission, the most effective techniques are Maintain cleanliness around the houses and communities, Maintain personal hygiene such as washing hands regularly, not touching contaminated and dirtier surfaces and objects and washing or sanitising hands as soon as possible after touching any surface, Maintaining safe distance of more than 2 metres from other people who are coughing or sneezing Avoid touching face, eyes, ears, nose etc. frequently, Covering mouth fully when coughing or sneezing. Not indulging in intoxicating activities such as smoking, drinking and other harmful things such as drugs, as these things weakens the nervous system as well as the respiratory system. Practise physical distancing, avoiding unnecessary travelling, staying away from large number of people or crowd. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and frequently touched objects • Practicing physical and exercise daily, inside the house or personal spaces so that immunity can be boosted. The novel virus is likely to have emerged from the Bats. The intermediate host might be a pangolin. The possible host of the new virus is still being researched upon. But it is certain that this virus has emerged due to mutations and adaptations. The virus has a unique ability to mutate rapidly and adapt a new host World Health Organisation (WHO), the global health organisation has played at significant role in dealing with the pandemic. It has emerged as a leading organisation involved in the global coordination for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. It declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and warned all countries to prepare. After the emergence of the COVID-19, WHO has been at the heart of the fight against the disease. It is intended to be an international leader in public health by alerting the world to the threats of diseases, developing policies to coordinate response to COVID and providing safety equipment’s to various countries. The WHO has spearheaded several initiatives like the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response, the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force, and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease. WHO agreed to an independent investigation into its handling of the pandemic? It announced the setting up of an independent Expert Review Committee to examine aspects of the international treaty that governs preparedness and response to health emergencies. WHO has shipped more than two million items of Personal Protective Equipments (PPES) and one million diagnostic test kits to over 120 countries. WHO has launched multilingual e-learning courses about various aspects of COVID-19, including for preparedness and response. WHO has been criticised also by the former US President Donald Trump terming it as China centric. It is alleged that WHO was slow to publicly recognise the threat posed by the COVID disease. Questions were raised on its contradictory statements regarding COVID But it is also true that world will need the WHO as only an International organisation like the WHO can coordinate efforts to tackle COVID on a global scale. COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerabilities of healthcare systems. It has affected people's primary healthcare provisions. It has highlighted the shortage of health infrastructure in terms of doctors, medical equipment, hospitals, healthcare workers both in terms of availability and accessibility. These pandemic affected workers of unorganised sector mostly who are daily wager or those working in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and left those jobless, and rapidly increased the unemployment rate. Due to lockdown as inter-state transportation services were shut down, farmers are unable to sell their crops in the market. They incurred huge losses and forced to throw out their crops. The revenue of the tourism sector got down due to a strict ban on both domestic and international flights. There has been fall in economic growth of the country as industries were shut India entered into a phase of technical recession. Due to the outbreak of the pandemic, most schools and educational institutions have closed down. The learning has become online which exposed the digital divide existing in the country. Also, the institutions are not equipped with digital technology and teachers also lack training in term of usage of these tools. The COVID-19 impacted the supply chains and production/manufacturing facilities of defence companies. As these companies have to depend on different component ion different sources located in affected countries and it lead to a decrease in demand for defence equipment Impact of COVID-19 on Global Economy Amid the coronavirus pandemic, several countries across the world adopted complete/partial lockdowns to flatten the curve of the infection. These lockdowns meant confining millions of citizens to their homes, shutting down businesses and ceasing almost all economic activity According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to shrink by over 3% in 2020, the steepest slowdown since the great depression of the 1930s The outbreak of COVID-19 has had deeper impact on Indian economy. A UN report estimated a trade impact of more, then USD 350 million on Indian economy due to this outbreak, making India one of, the worst affected economies across the world Lockdown had put great stress on the supply chains of essential commodities and therefore, many of the Indian companies have focused on the production and supply of essential items only. It thereby stopped all other production activities. After the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, government suspended all the International VISAs, domestic flights and restricted the movement of the people by imposing Nationwide lockdowns so, that the transmission of the disease could be stopped and people do not get infected. The most important steps included. 1. Arogya Setu App - It launched the Arogya Setu App which was developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). It uses smartphone's bluetooth and GPS features to track the Novel coronavirus transmission. It informs the individuals and authorities in case someone has been infected by the COVID disease. It has a self-assessment test, do's and dont's and gives recommendations. 2. Atmanirbhar Package - Government announced 20 lakh crore Atmanirbhar Package in total five tranches. The package will be used for frontline workers, farmers, building and construction workers, MSME sector, banks, and several direct tax measures. It also includes a package for enhancing ease of doing business reforms. 3. Supplying foodgrains - The Food Corporation of India supplied 126 tonnes of foodgrains to States and Linion Territories during the COVID lockdown. The government also extended the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till November 2020 to provide rice, wheat, chana to 80 crore Indians for free. 4. Producing PPE Kits - India ramped up the production of PPE kits and became the second largest producer of PPE-Personal Protective Equipment in the world with daily production of over 5 lakh kits. In terms of the production of ventilators, India has scaled up its capacity to over 3 lakh ventilators per annum. India has significantly indigenised production of medical devices 5. Shramik Trains - Hundreds of Shramik special trains were run by the railways to transport the migrant workers to their home places. Stranded workers, students. pilgrims, tourists etc. were transported to their native states. The Railways subsidised the fare for these special trains by upto 85% of the cost. The remaining cost was borne by states. 6. Vocal for Local Campaign - The Prime Minister urged the people to buy locally produced goods and services so that India could quickly rebuild its economy and become self-reliant. There is an urgent need to recognise the importance of local manufacturing, local markets and supply chain. 7. Vaccine Development - Indian firms have been quick to respond to the demands of a vaccine for COVID. There are three firms that are in the race of making a COVID vaccine. India is one of the countries that started phase three trials within 6 months of the COVID outbreak.  The world has united to fight against COVID-19. Countries are making efforts to develop vaccine to win the battle against the pandemic. Sputnik V, a coronavirus vaccine launched by Russia is touted as the world's first such vaccine. Currently, WHO and Russian health authorities are discussing the process for possible WHO prequalification for its newly approved COVID-19 vaccine. British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have worked together to develop non-replicating viral vector vaccine named ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. It has been found to be safe and induced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials. India has participated equally in developing vaccine for treating COVID-19. Serum Institute of India (SII) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) have announced an agreement with pharmaceutical major Merck to develop SARS-CoV-2 neutralising Monoclonal Antibodies. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has developed Covaxin, an indigenous vaccine. The vaccine makes use of an inactive version of a virus to spike up production of antibodies in the host body. Ahmedabad-based pharma giant, Zydus Cadila has made two versions of vaccines. The company is testing two versions of its vaccine, one which makes use of molecular DNA to elicit an immune response, while the other uses a live measles viral strain to provide protection. The vaccine is expected to be available by March 2021. HGCO 19 vaccine has been developed by Gennova Biopharmaceuticals-HDT Bio This vaccine belongs to a newer category called RNA vaccines, which make use of the messenger RNA molecules to recreate the Covid-19 spike protein-the spikes found on the surface of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Presently, the world is not prepared to face another pandemic. It has also been proven by the fact that world's largest healthcare system of USA is not able to contain the deaths of its citizens. Infectious diseases together account for more than 13 million deaths every year worldwide Infections spread from one regions to another rapidly due to globalisation, urbanisation, climate change as well as ecological pressures. All these factors also contribute in the emergence of new viruses due to mutations and adaptations these conditions, if not controlled are likely to cause Pandemics and affect the global population. The world must start immediately to prepare for another pandemic as almost 2/3rd of the new diseases affecting humans have become zoonotic infections caused by pathogens originating in animals. The rise in international trade of exotic animals, intensive and unhygienic livestock farming, rapid urbanisation, encroachments into wildlife habitats must be slowed down and stopped. Large scale environmental exploitation has played a key role in emergence of new pathogens with receding glaciers, the viruses that were hitherto unknown to humans are able to invade new hosts and create futile grounds for new pandemics. Negligence of environment, ecology and biodiversity for short term gains may cost the world and grant it with another pandemic of much large scale and intensity. Thus, there is an urgent need that each country in the world must enhance its preparedness and competence to prevent, detect and respond to public health emergences. It will involve surveillance, risk, reduction, capacity building, and effort and commitment.  The COVID-19 disease has exposed the fragile basis of our society. It has also given us a chance to build a more sustainable and inclusive future. After we have recovered from COVID-19, the world must push towards a more sustainable lifestyle. Reducing materialism, caring for Mother Nature, working for the family's wellness, healthy diet and regular exercise shall be the priority of nations and individuals that form them. The protection of natural resources and wise use of exhaustible resources should drive the new lifestyle. Healthcare needs of the countries should be taken into account while preparing policies. There will be raised awareness about personal as well as social hygiene and cleanliness. People will continue the use of masks and face covers as to protect themselves from close contacts with people. The rapid urbanisation that has created huge unsustainable cities and metros will be decongested to create spaces for public as well social and community activity that requires open spaces. The education sector will need to recalibrate itself for the digital mode of education as to prevent congestion of classrooms and due to its unique advantages too. To reduce chances of contamination, schools and educational institutions will need to modernise their teaching techniques. Work culture will shift towards working from home and remote locations as it is cost effective and efficient. More companies as well as employees will adopt working from home with the use of modern technology. The most important of all will be to imbibe a sense of care in the people's mind and hearts to care for the environment. The world nations should join hands to recognise the importance of sustainable interrelation between people, animals and their shared environment. This will optimise health outcomes, reduce risk and strengthen preventive efforts to prevent another pandemic and if it occurs then mitigate the effects on the people.",      
    "Topic5": "The globe is changing constantly at a fast pace as the new power centres are, the emerging and older ones rejuvenating. The Chinese aggression in its maritime and land domain is a fine example of the quick and rapid changes occurring in the neighbourhood of India. In this context, the four countries of Quad have strengthened their efforts, including India, to secure their interests in all the spheres such as political, economic, environmental, security etc. India has significant strategic interests in the Indo-pacific region. To secure its interests against the unilateral rise of Chinese aggression, it will need to form strategic alliances such as Quad grouping. Quad or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is an informal strategic dialogue between four countries that include India, Australia, USA and the Island nation of Japan. It aims to ensure and support a ‘free, open and prosperous’ Indo-Pacific region. The idea of Quad grouping was first given by the former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the year 2007. At that time, the idea could not move forward as Australia had pulled out apparently due to Chinese pressure. Another reason for the discontinuation of Quad included more Beijing friendly regime in Japan and reiteration of India-China relationship. During the 2017 ASEAN summit, all the four members re-joined the negotiations to revive this quadrilateral security alliance. They gave shape to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-pacific region free of any influence, especially Chinese influence. The organisation now aims to promote a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific amid China's aggressive postures in the region.’ India, Japan and USA were in talks to invite Australia for a quadrilateral coordinated navy exercise at Malabar. This military exercise will give a new military dimension to the Quad grouping. These four countries have strongly asserted their views that China's growing assertiveness should be contained in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad, apart from containing China's growing influence, also provides freedom from uncertainties in the Asian region. The Quad is also a grouping of likeminded democratic countries that will certainly help in promoting the values of democracy, rules, diversity, cooperation and inclusiveness. It will be more sustainable if the countries are able to balance their interests and include more substantive dimensions apart from the current ones. The Quad is a forum for diplomatic consultation. The meetings of Quad have sought to address the broader agendas of the Indo-Pacific region. There is high level of policy coordination between the members that impact the rules based regional order, including maritime security, terrorism, cyber security and connectivity. The Quad can complement even the ASEAN cooperation that is helpful for maintaining peace and prosperity in the Asian region. Intelligence Quad is not yet a strategic alliance. So, there are limitations as how much intelligence can be shared between its members. Despite this, there are increasing signs of information sharing in a number of military sectors, including maritime domain awareness As the Quad member's major military assets are located throughout the Indian Ocean and this immense geographical range provides a certain strategic advantage. The information sharing can be enhanced in the maritime sector to tackle issues such as maritime terrorism and piracy. All the four countries are building information networks with Australia, Japan and USA sharing defence related information through an agreement. India has also begun to create the foundations for information sharing with USA and Japan. Military component of the Quad does not play an important part in deterrence. Military cooperation among the four members of Quad are limited. But military-to-military cooperation is necessary. Measures can be taken to improve the preparedness of military for any contingency in the Indo-Pacific. There must be capacity building of the Indo-Pacific regional states. Military technology and defence equipment transfer will also be essential States in the region still rely on major powers such as Russia and USA. India can also play atleast a supplementary role in enhancing the military capabilities of the regional states. Economy The economic aspect of Quad will include economic integration and regional connectivity. China's Belt and Road Initiative has made significant impact on the existing rules of development of infrastructure. The capital provided by China to various developing countries is used by them to fulfil their infrastructural needs. The regional connectivity initiatives should aim at integrating the far West Asia and Central Asian region with the South-East Asia through the Indian Ocean. Investments to create strategic infrastructure should be undertaken to improve regional connectivity and secure mutual interests in trade, commerce, connectivity, peace and prosperity. The four member countries of the Quad have some common reservations regarding China's influence in the region as these countries are affected by China's growing influence in their respective sphere of influence. USA has followed a consistent policy to restrain China's increasing influence in East Asia. USA sees Quad as an opportunity to regain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The USA has described China as a strategic rival in its national security strategy, national defence strategy and Pentagon's report on the Indo-Pacific strategy. Australia has been concerned about China's growing interests in its land, infrastructure, politics and its universities. Taking in account its overwhelming economic dependence on China for the prosperity of the continent, it has continued its commitment to a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. It is seeking to shift away from its overwhelming dependence on China. Japan has expressed concerns related to China's territorial transgression in the region. As Japan has also large trade relations with China therefore, Japan has to balance its economic needs and territorial concerns. India China's violation of international norms, boundary transgressions in India, construction of military facilities etc. have posed a serious challenge for India. India needs to confront the Chinese aggression on its borders, secure its land as well as maritime interests and maintain strategic autonomy. For India, there are face-offs at the border, the effects of One Belt One Road Initiative and impact of China-Pakistan economic corridor on its strategic landscape. The Quad provides it with many advantages to eliminate these challenges. The opportunities for India include 1. Increased Defence - Spending China spends huge sums on its defence sector that is more than the collective spending of Japan, Australia and India together. The presence of USA in the grouping will provide a necessary boost to the defence sector of India as it will aid in technology transfer and defence cooperation. 2. Secured Borders - With Chinese aggression on India's borders, Quad can prove to be an effective alliance to reduce Chinese influence in the border regions of India. The situation in the Northern borders has been worsened by both China's and Pakistan's influence in pressurising India. Quad can play a balancing role in this situation. 3. Sustainability in Indian Ocean - Indian Ocean is the only ocean of the world that is named after a country that is India. India has the responsibility to act as the net security provider in the Indian Ocean region. For providing sustainability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean region, India along with the Quad nations can counter Chinese String of Pearls or Maritime Silk Road and its debt trap diplomacy. 4. India's Act East Policy - India's Act East policy that aims to promote economic strategic and cultural relations with vast Asia-Pacific region will be strengthened with the involvement of India with Quad grouping. It will also provide a boost to the vision of SAGAR- Security and Growth for all in the region. 5. Stability in the Region - India is concerned about the declining significance of USA and growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean and Asian region. This imbalance created by such a situation may create instabilities in the regions that affect India's interests. Thus, Quad grouping can be an opportunity to infuse stability in its neighbourhood region. Challenges with Quad Though the Quad Grouping has many perceptible advantages but it has various issues that need to be resolved to make it a success. These issues include 1. An Undefined Vision Despite the potential for cooperation, the Quad remains a mechanism without any defined strategic objectives. This can also be ascertained by the separate interests of each country in the grouping. India wants to advance the security and economic interests of all countries in region whereas US wants a formal alliance. 2. Non-alignments India's foreign policy works on the principle of Non-alignment. India will need to abandon its strategy of non-alignment in order to counter the Chinese threat by having a formal alliance with US and other two countries in the form of Quad. 3. Chinese Closeness to ASEAN China has advanced huge loans to the ASEAN region. It has also several strategic infrastructure projects and military bases in various islands of ASEAN countries Chinese influence has further grown in the ASEAN after the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) pact. 4. No Convergence among Members All the Quad members have different strategic interests. They look forward to the Quad to enhance their own interests and fulfil their aspirations. A coherent vision among the Quad members is absent. Though advances have been made in various talks among the members but a common and long term vision document is necessary. The Quad will have to evolve a clear vision for itself. It will need to move beyond the China centricity and be open towards accommodating each other's interests and ensure that talks of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific’ is more than just talks The Quad should focus on building a robust regional mechanism and cooperate with all the regional players to evolve a more inclusive Asia, simultaneously balancing each other's interests.",      
    "Topic6": "Agricultural marketing system is an efficient method of distributing farmer's surplus produce at a fair and reasonable price. The term 'market refers place where there is exchange of goods between the producer and the consumer but agricultural marketing involves operations such as procurement, grading, collecting, preserving, transportation and financing. An efficient and stable marketing system is essential for the development of agriculture sector. It provide the farmer an opportunity to increase production, commercialise operations and incentivise farmers to produce diverse varieties of crops. Though reforming the agricultural marketing system is usually separated from agricultural farm and farmers but, it is directly related to improvements in the living standard of farmers, which aims to make India free from hunger and turn poverty into prosperity. Agriculture marketing plays a significant role in improving production, produce and consumption. It also helps in accelerating the pace of economic development. It has direct bearing on the life of the farmers as India is primarily an agricultural country and more than 60% of the population depends upon agriculture. Indian farmers also produce a significant quantity of cash crops they require transportation, storage and distribution to urban markets. Marketing infrastructure is necessary to transport such cash crops. Agriculture sector supplies raw materials to industries and therefore marketing crops such as cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, etc. are important. It is also required for shifting from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture in India. Also, an increase in the efficiency of marketing results in lower costs of distribution to the consumers that also raises the national income. Marketing also aids in bringing new varieties, qualities and beneficial goods to t consumers. It can also boost the growth of a number of agro-based processing industries. If agricultural marketing is managed scientifically, it stabilises price levels and plays an important role in economic development and stability of a country. The existing system of agricultural marketing in India is in the form of following types of markets are 1. Direct Sale to Traders and Moneylenders in Villages. A considerable part of total produce of farmer is sold by him to village traders and moneylenders at very low prices. The moneylenders or traders are either independent or may act as an agent of a bigger merchant in the nearby mandi. In India, more than 50% of the agricultural produce is sold in the local village markets in the absence of organised market systems. 2. Weekly Haats and Shed Weekly haats and sheds are organised once or twice in a week or on special occasions or longer intervals. The agents of wholesale merchants operating in different mandies visit these markets. These types of markets are poorly equipped, are uncovered and lack storage, drainage and other facilities. Only small and marginal farmers who have no access to the bigger markets sell their produce in such markets. 3. Mandies or Wholesale Markets One single mandi serves a large number of villages. Mandies are generally located in cities. In such mandies, business is carried out by Ahartiyas (commission agents). The farmers sell their produce to these Ahartiyas with the help of middlemen. The middlemen are often involved in malpractices. The Ahartiyas of these mandies sell the produce to the retail merchants. These mandies are regulated by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). Under APMC Act, farmers are required to sell a large number of commodities in these mandies where prices are often manipulated. These mandies also lack storage, warehousing etc. 4. Cooperative Markets A cooperative society collects surplus from its members and sell it at the mandies collectively. This is the cooperative system of marketing. It increases the collective bargaining power of the members and they are able to obtain better price of their produce. In addition to the sale of produce, these societies also serve the farmers in a number of ways. They also provide finances to the members and incentivises them to grow better quality crops. 5. Contract Farming Contract farming has emerged as an important mode of procurement of agricultural goods by several agribusiness firms which are private, public or cooperatives. There is an advance agreement of the farmer with the large firms that procure the produce of a pre-determined quality at fixed prices. This type of marketing is quite beneficial to the farmer, but the outreach of this type of farming is very low in India: Issues of Agri-Marketing Systems in India Farmers in India are not able to get a fair and remunerative price as a consequence of the defects in Indian agriculture marketing system. Various committees and groups have been setup to bring out the inadequacies in the agricultural marketing systems across India. The weaknesses of India's agricultural marketing are: 1. Irregular Warehousing - There are absence of proper warehousing facilities in the villages. Farmers are compelled to store their products in pits, mud-vessels, kutcha storehouses. This leads to a considerable wastage of agricultural products and valuable production gets rotten due to improper storage facilities. 2. Lack of Standardisation - The quality of agricultural produce is not graded properly due to lack of standardisation. Better quality produce and poor quality produce are considered as one and sold in a common lot at same prices. The farmer who has invested more for producing higher quality crops does not get a fair price. 3. Poor Transport Facility - Only a small number of villages are connected by railways and pucca roads to the agricultural Various small carry their produce on slow and old means of transport such as bullocks. Such means of transport are inadequate to carry production to far off places Due to these reasons the farmers have to dump their produce in nearby markets even if the sale is at very low prices. This is true even with the perishable commodities that require quick transport facilities. 4. Presence of Middlemen - The middlemen in agricultural marketing system cut through the farmer's revenue by as much as 50%. The chain of intermediaries in the marketing is very large The farmers have to sell their produce to these intermediaries as a result of which their share of profit is reduced. 5. Inadequate Market Information - It is not possible for small as well as marginal farmers to obtain information on exact market prices in different markets. The middlemen take advantage of the illiteracy and ignorance of the farmers. Often, unfair means are used to cheat the farmers. There are various unspecified and hidden charges levied by the middlemen upon these illiterate farmers. 6. Lack of Organisation - There is lack of collective organisation on the part of Indian farmers. This reduces their collective bargaining power and reduces profits. They have to bow down to wishes of the functionaries in the markets. If the farmer himself does not learn the system of marketing, he will not be able to bargain with the buyers who are well informed. There are delays in making payments to these farmers many times high interest is also charged by local traders because of no bargaining power of the farmer. 7. Malpractices in Markets - Several types of malpractices are prevalent in the agricultural markets, false weights and other unfair means are used by the functionaries in the market. Various unspecified charges are taken from the farmers. Small, illiterate and unorganised farmers are often cheated by employing fraudulent methods. The government has been trying to reform the agricultural marketing system. The APMC acts have been amended several times to facilitate better price for farmers Cooperatives and contract farming have been explored to give farmers professionalised services so that they are compensated for their crops fairly and at good profits. But these reforms have been inadequate and farmers continue to be exploited.  The government introduced three new acts to professionalise marketing of agriculture in India and ensure the welfare of farmers. These acts are the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation Bill) that aims to perm the sale of agricultural produce outside the mandies regulated by APMCs. This will make the marketing of agricultural produce easier and profitable for farmers. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill aims to explore and develop contract farming so that farmers can benefit collectively and the Essential Commodities. Bill seeks to deregulate the production, supply, and distribution of food items such as cereals, Potatoes, pulses, onions and edible oilseeds. The benefits of these new bills for farmers will be 1. The new laws allows the farmers to sell their crops anywhere outside the mandies. This will enable them to fetch better prices for their produce and prevent their exploitation by the middlemen present in the APMC mandies. 2. Farmer will benefit from the direct market linkages and supply chains. They will not be required to pay any additional sum of money like in the APMC mandies. This increases their profit margins. 3. Agri tech startups, food processors, exporters etc. will also be benefitted due to the new laws. This will improve the conditions of both the farmers as well as reduce the prices for consumers. 4. As time will move, new private markets will be setup in various places because of demands from these places Farmers will be able to sell their products in these markets without payment of any additional fees or cess. The new private players will also provide professionalised services to the farmers such as proper and scientific grading, pick up services, transport, digital payments, bonus offers, a better refrigeration and storage, live tracking of their produce etc. 5. Online agri-trade and market places will also be setup on the lines of the e-commerce websites. This will eliminate the large chain of middlemen and intermediaries and reduce the farmer's interaction with the cumbersome bureaucratic setup. 6. Participation of private players and lesser regulation of markets will also improve the supply chains, increase investments in the marketing system and may also result in emergence of innovative solutions to solve common problems of Indian agriculture. 7. Efficient supply chains are also going to reduce farm and transport wastages of the crops produced by the farmers Perishable items will be transported and stored easily. Reduced wastage will surely incentivise the farmers to grow more such crops. 8. Contract farming will be given a push and it will reduce price risk for the farmers. The farmer will get a pre-determined price for his produce as per the agreed quality of crops. 9. Cooperative farming will also be promoted that will strengthen the bargaining power of the farmers. It will also reduce the intermediary chains in the marketing of produce so that the farmer grow best crops and not worry about the price they will get. Though the farm bills promise a better price and better life to the farmers as well as the consumers but there are several concerns that have gone unaddressed. The farmers have protested in several states as there have been no consultations, debate and dialogue before passing these bills. Farmers fear that these bills will tend the minimum price support provided by the government. The lack of 1 bargaining power of farmers as compared to the large companies is a major concern. There is hardly any regulation outside the APMC mandies and farmers are concerned that they may be exploited by the private players without any government regulations. The changed, stock limits will directly affect the farmers in negative ways. The state needs to take this concern into notice and resolve and address them by wider public consultation and debate. The new laws promise a lot to the farmers of India and this opportunity should not be wasted.",      
    "Topic7": "In a major boost to Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter jet squadron, five Rafale fighter jets were inducted into IAF on 10th September, 2020. These fighter jet have been inducted into IAP's Squadron 17. The induction was performed by Union Defence Minister and his french counterpart.  These fighter jets can carry three more payload than the current Tejas jet The Rafale fighter jet is important for strengthening the military capabilities of India It is significant for providing a strategic advantage to India's military in in currently disturbed neighbourhood. The fighter jets, built by French Aviation firm Dassault took off from the Merignac Air Base in Southern France's Bordeaux and reached Ambala Air Base c 29th July, 2020. It covered a distance of about 7000 km from France to India with air-to-air refuelling and a single stop at the French Air Base in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It was a moment of extraordinary pride for the IAF pilots who brought the Rafale fighter aircrafts to India from France. The pilots include Group Captain Singh (Jaipur, Rajasthan), who is the commanding officer of 17 squadron of IAF, Group Captain Kataria (Gurugram Haryana), Wing Commander Tripathi (Jalore, Rajasthan), Wing Commander Singh (Balliya, Uttar Pradesh), Wing Commander Siddhu and Wing Commander Arun (Bihar). The touchdown of Rafale combat aircrafts in India marks the beginning of a new era in military history of India. The first squadron has been readied in the Ambala Air Base whereas the second one will be readied in the Hasimara Air force station in West Bengal. In August 2007, Ministry of Defence, under the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government issued a request for proposal to procure 126 Medium Multirole Combat Aircraft (MMCRA) fighters. After four years, in May 2011, Air Force shortlisted Rafale and Eurofighter jets. Dassault Aviation of France came up with the lowest bid in January 2012 after which a Work Share Agreement was signed between Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Dassault Aviation of France. Under the 2014 Agreement between the two, the work to build 108 aircrafts was shared in the ratio of 70 per cent and 30 per cent between the two organisations respectively. The remaining 18 aircrafts were to be imported into India in a fly away condition. However, India and France were unable to decide the price of the aircraft. In 2015, under the present NDA government, Prime Minister Harrales Medi vid Paris in April 2015 and announced a decision to buy 36 Rafale fighters via pernment to government deal. French President Francois Hollande vital India January 2016 and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on purchase of Rafale jets is signed between India and France for $ 78 billion (1900) come) In this deal, HAL was replaced by Reliance Defence Limited (RDI) as the offset partner in the deal. The present deal was criticised by the opposition parties including the Congress Party on the basis of the higher prices of the current deal. The criticis was based on the promise that under the UPA government, the price of one aircraft was only 629 crores whereas under the present government, the price has gone up to nearly 1611 crores The Rafale aircraft will be important for India as it is presently facing a two-front war from both China and Pakistan Under the deal Dansult has promised that all the rafales will be delivered to India by the end of 2021 in various phases. The Rafale jet has become the most advanced fighter jet in Indian Air Force Beet. As compared to the Sukhoi SL-MKI 30 (currently the best aircraft), the Rafale is faster and has a wide range and more capabilities. It is an 'omnirole' aircraft and comes with a host of weapons and can perform a variety of function such as aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence. It is a 45 generation aircraft that has supersonic abilities. It can attack any target from surface-to-air as well as air-to-air. Rafale's combat radius is 3700 km which is far greater than China's J-20 Combat Aircraft's radius of 3400 km. The main features of Rafale are, it has a top speed of 1.8 Mach and has overall empty weight of 10 tonnes. It can carry a maximum take-off weight of 24.5 tonnes. It has a total length of 15.3 metres and wing span of 10.9 metres. The Rafale has a service range of 50,000 feet with a top speed of 2222 km/hr. Though it has an overall range of 3700 km but it can be extended with the help of mid-air refuelling. This fighter jet is equipped with stealth technology, which can effectively hide it from the enemy radars. It is smaller than the Sukhoi aircraft and hence it can be advantageous for the Indian Air Force during warfare. The Rafale is a nuclear ready aircraft as it can deliver nuclear weapons from both surface-to-air as well as air-to-air. It is equipped with oxygen generation system due to which there is no need to refill liquid oxygen. One of the special feature of Rafale is that it can take off from a smaller runway of 1300 feet which makes it capable of launching from an aircraft carrier ship. The Rafale cockpit has Hands on Throttle and Stick Control (HOTAS). It is equipped with a heads up-wide angle holographic display from Thales Avionique which provides aircraft with control data, mission data and firing targets. The Rafale is powered by two M88-2 engines from SNECMA. It is suitable for low altitude penetration and high altitude penetration missions. The Radar system in Rafale is more powerful from Sukhoi MKP's PESA radar. The missiles also have GPS enabled navigation system and imaging infrared terminal guidance. The missile system of Rafale has the potential to integrate a large variety of current and future armaments. The Rafale can incorporate following missile systems 1. It is an air-to-air Beyond Visual Range (BVR) interception, combat and sel defense missile. This missile is able to fire upto 100 kms and is already incorporated in the current Mirage fighter jet. METEOR - It is a very long range air-to-air missile. It is a very long range rocket and ram-jet powered air-to-air missile. It has a striking capability of 150 km. The combination of Meteor weapons system with the Rafale jet is a game changer for India. 2. HAMMER - It is Highly Agile and Manoeuvrable Munition Extended Range Missile It is modular, rocket-boosted air-to-ground precision guided weapon series missile. It is fitted with GPS and imaging infrared guidance kit that enables it to hit its targets precisely. 3. Other missiles on the Rafale include SCALP long-range stand-off missile. It also has an AM39 EXOCET anti-ship missile. It can carry laser guided bombs with different warheads varying from 500 lbs to 2000 lbs. The most important feature in the missile systems of Rafale is that it can be customised according to the specific needs of countries. The idea to induct additional fighter jets in the IAF has been there since 2001. The actual process began in 2007. The Defence Acquisition Council, headed by the then Defence Minister approved the tender to buy 126 aircrafts in August 2007. Now the Rafale jets have been incorporated in the Indian Air Force, they will be able to provide unmatched capabilities to the IAF. The following are the benefits of Rafale for India Rafale can easily take off from high altitude Leh and Ladakh region on a cold start. This will be beneficial for India as it is facing a threat from both the Pakistan as well as Chinese side. Indian forces can manage any threat on the border with the versatile capabilities of Rafale. India will have unmatched air power with the inclusion of 36 fighter Rafales in the Air Force. It can be used to manage the neighbourhood challenge that has become disturbed after the Chinese incursions into Indian Territory in Ladakh region. The sanctioned strength of IAF squadrons is 42 but India has currently only 31 squadrons. To improve the squadrons strength Rafale will be helpful. The previous aircrafts bought by India were Sukhoi in 1996. Rafale will provide a necessary upgrade to the IAF's fighting capabilities. India is a regional player in South Asia. Rafale's inclusion will give a necessary boost to the regional power dynamics of India in South Asia. It is one of the finest combat aircrafts available in the global market. It is much more advanced than China's J20 aircraft, which is its main rival in the region. The aircraft has proved its unmatched capabilities in air combat missions in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria in the last few years. India has become fourth country to have the strategic platform after France, Egypt and Qatar. The nuclear delivery capabilities of India will be strengthened further with the inclusion of Rafale in IAF.",      
    "Topic8": "The Nobel Prize is widely considered as the most prestigious award given for the exemplary contribution to humanity in the field of Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Economics and Peace. It is awarded annually by Swedish and Norwegian Institutions, according to the will established by Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Bernhard Nobel in 1895. In his will, Nobel instructed that the majority of his funds should be set aside for awarding prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The Nobel prizes, initially a set of five awards, were first awarded in 1901. An additional award, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden and was first awarded in 1969. It is also presented at the Nobel Prize Award ceremony. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics, Chemistry and Economics. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute Awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for Peace. The Nobel Prize nomination and selection process is long and rigorous. This is an important reason why the prizes have grown in importance and prestige over the years to become the most important prizes in their field. Unlike many other awards, the Nobel Prize nominees are never publicly announced and they are not supposed to be told that they were ever considered for the prize. After the nomination deadline, a committee compiles and writes a report with recommendations and sends it to the academy or other corresponding institution. Depending on the category of the prize, the members of the institution then vote to select the winner. Posthumous (after death) nominations for the Prize have been disallowed since 1974. Only in two cases the prize has been awarded posthumously to people who were nominated when they were still alive. This was the case with UN Secretary General Dg Hammarskjold (1961 Peace Prize) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1931 Prize in Literature), both of them were awarded the prize in the years they died. The prize ceremonies take place annually in Stockholm, Sweden except for the Peace prize which is held in Oslo, Norway. Each recipient, or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation. (As of 2018, each prize is worth SEK (Swedish Krona) 10 million or about US$ 1.1 million. The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was announced by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 6th October, 2020. The award in physics was given to three astrophysicists Roger Penrose from UK, Reinhard Genzel from Germany and Andrea Ghez from USA. Roger Penrose discovered that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the General Theory of relativity Genzel and Ghez received the award for the discovery of a super massive black hole at the centre of Milky Way. Their discoveries have revolutionised the study of compact and supermassive objects and has solved many questions. Chemistry The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on 7th October, 2020 Emanuelle Charpantier and Jenniffer A Doudna from France and USA respectively got the award for discovering the CRISPR/Cas 9 genetic scissors. Their discovery had already contributed to significant gains in crop resilience, new cancer therapies and resistance from various diseases. Genetic scissors have become a new tool in the hands of scientists to rewrite the code of life. Physiology The Prize in Physiology or medicine was announced on 5th October, 2020 by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska institute in Sweden. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to American medical researchers and virologists Harvey J Alter and Charles M Rice. The award was also shared by Michael Houghton from Britain. The award in Physiology was awarded for the discovery of Hepatitis C Virus in the year 1982 by screening millions of DNA samples. The discovery has been significant in making new medicines and blood tests that have saved millions of lives. Peace The Nobel Peace Prize 2020 was announced on 9th October, 2020 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was given to the World Food Programme (WFP), a United Nations agency for its efforts to combat hunger as a weapon of war and conflict. The World Food Programme provided assistance to over 100 million people in 88 countries who were victims of acute food insecurity and hunger. The award in Economic Sciences was presented at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 12th October, 2020. The Prize in Economic Sciences, known as Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, was awarded to Paul R Milgrom and Robert-Wilson for their work on commercial auctions. Robert Wilson developed the theory for auctions of objects with a common value and Paul Milgrom formed a more general theory of auctions. Their work has benefitted buyers, sellers and taxpayers around the world. It was announced at the Swedish Academy on 8th October, 2020. The prize in Literature was awarded to Louise Gluck, a poet from USA for her unmistakable poetic voice. Her poetry focuses on the painful reality of human beings, dealing with themes such as death, childhood, and family life. She is the fourth woman to win the Nobel Prize for literature since 2010 and 16’ won to win it since its inception. Among the total recipients over the years, 13 are Indians (5 Indian citizens and 8 of Indian origin or residency) Rabindranath Tagore was the first Indian citizen to be awarded and Mother Teresa is the only woman in the list 1. Rabindranath Tagore was the first Indian to receive Nobel Prize in the year 1913. He received this award for his work Geetanjali. He was awarded with Nobel Prize in Literature for his poetic thoughts. 2 CV Raman was the second person to be awarded Nobel Prize in the year 1930. He was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics for finding the Raman Effect 3. Hargobind Khorana received Nobel Prize in Medicine in the year 1968 in the field of genetics. He with other two scientists interpreted the genetic code and its functions in protein synthesis. 4. Mother Teresa was the first Indian woman to receive Nobel Prize. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in the year 1979. She was born as Anjeze Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in Macedonia but was awarded Indian citizenship in the year 1948. 5. Subramaniam Chandrasekhar won the Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 1983 for his study on the physical processes important to the structure and evolution of stars. 6. Amartya Sen was awarded Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in the year 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. 7. VS Naipaul was the seventh Indian to win a Nobel Prize. He was awarded with Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001. 8. RK Pachauri He was awarded Nobel Peace Prize in the year 2007 for his contribution in the field of climate change. He was the chairman of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from 2002-2015. 9. V. Ramakrishnan was awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 for contributing to the studies of structure and function of Ribosome 10. Kailash Satyarthi was awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for his contribution to the struggle against suppression of children and young people. 11. Abhijeet Banerjee was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his contribution to alleviate global poverty in the year 2019. The Nobel Prizes are now well established and their future is full of optimism, positivity and hope. However, there has been a mixed response to the award money given in the Nobel Prizes. Some hold the opinion that the huge sum given as prize money may corrupt the intellectual ambition of scientists and writers. Some have the opinion that the prizes are admired as they are reliably honouring the major achievements and progress across the world. Nobel certifies that things are important in Science, Medicine, Literature and the area of peace' must be appreciated. Therefore, it provides a desperately needed symbol of authority and recognition of merit when all the other benchmarks are under attack",      
    "Topic9": "The development of a nation and society goes hand in hand with the development of the individual. When the society and the nation develop, it has a direct impact upon the development of an individual and vice-versa. With the coming of the 21st century, the entire world is witnessing a period of intense transformation in all areas such as education, global trade, economy, technology or society. The COVID-19 has also challenged the individual to cope up with its impacts. Thus, for such times when transformation is taking place quickly, a new and upgraded skill set is required for the students so that they are able to cope up with changing realities to face challenges in real life, leading to their comprehensive progress. The new 21st century skills would enable the students to contribute to the progress of the society and the nation. Empowering our students with these skills is also a challenging task. The government has adopted and initiated several innovative policies and practices so that the younger generation of students can be empowered with 21st century skills. The new education policy is a step forward in providing 21st century skills to the students. The Prime Minister has also mentioned the importance of inculcating 21st century skills in the students in his 'Mann ki Baat' program. He has focussed upon critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, curiosity and communication for the students so that they can be ready for facing the challenges of 21st century. The term 21st century skills refer to a broad set of knowledge, skills, work habits, and character traits that are believed by educators, reformers, college faculties, employers etc. to be critically important for success in today's world. Simply, these skills are those skills that are required by an individual to face the challenges of the 21st century world which is characterised by a digitally transforming, globally active, collaborative, forward moving, creatively progressing and quickly adopting world. The students of 21st century will require skills such as critical thinking and problem solving, collaboration and leadership, agility and adaptability, initiative and entrepreneurialism, oral and written communication, information analysis etc. On the basis of historical development of 21st century skills, these can be broadly divided into learning skills, life skills and literacy skills Learning Skills required for the acquisition of new knowledge. Learning skills involve critical thinking, creativity and innovation, collaboration and communication. Literacy Skills that help in creating and gaining new knowledge through reading, media and digital resources Literacy skills involve information literacy, media literacy and technology literacy. Life Skills required for successfully leading and living everyday life. Life skills include flexibility and adaptability, leadership and responsibility, initiative interaction. and self-direction, social and cross-cultural Defining the 21st Century Skills Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Critical thinking is the capability of an individual to objectively analyse a piece of information without any biases. It involves fairness and open-mindedness, being informed and active, being independent, willingness to question and to entertain doubts and recognising and assessing values, peer pressure and media influences. Problem solving involves identifying relevant information by filtering out irrelevant data, and relating the set of information with another to solve the current problem on the basis of previous experience. These skills enable the student to analyse and evaluate various perspectives and interpret available information to reach conclusions. It enables the student to solve real world problems by exploring and observing their surroundings carefully. Creativity and Innovation Creativity refers to new ways of seeing or doing things by generating new ideas (fluency), flexibility (shifting perspective easily). Originality (conceiving something new) and elaboration (building on other's idea), Innovation means creation of something new, unique which is an improved version of the existing idea and is distinctive. These skills enable students to bring out new ideas by brainstorming. They are able to use all the available concepts to create useful ideas and simultaneously improve one's creativity. The students learn how to communicate the new ideas to others. Collaboration is the ability to effectively work together with others. It involves working together, respecting other's needs and perspectives and contributing to and accepting the final outcome Collaboration broadens the cultural, social and environmental boundaries and helps a student to understand social and environmental concerns better. Communication is the ability to express one's opinions, desires, needs, apprehensions oneself appropriately in a verbal and non-verbal manner. Communication skills can be used by the students for a variety of purposes. They are able to effectively disburse their ideas to others as well as listen to others carefully to infer meanings. They are able to use several forms of media and technologies with ease and know their usefulness with the help of good communication skills. Information Skills involve the ability to access information, media and technology to understand and critically evaluate different aspects of cost and information and create and communicate with ease with the help of informational skills students critically access and evaluate information and manage information from a wide variety of sources. They have to underhand the sources of information and understand the issues they face. Flexibility and Adaptability-  Flexibility refers to person's ability to change in actions and steps taken by him according to new situation and efficiently facing difficult situation without compromising on values Adaptability is a person's quality where they can modify or change one to suit a new environment. Fur our students, these skills are of utmost importance as they help them in moving forward in difficult times. Leadership and Responsibility - Leadership is the ability to guide a teams and be capable of managing a team in relation to real world. These skills enable to be committed, resilient and confident, Responsibility means being a good on being aware of the important social and national issues that have impact on our daily life as a citizen and student and being aware of our Fundamental Duties and Rights. Initiative and Self-Direction - Initiative means the ability to begin a task independently and self-direction refers to working with integrity on self-motivation. These skills enables a student to work readily with diverse groups. They are able to manage time properly and are able to critically analyse their past to make the future better. Productivity can be understood as fulfilment of any task within a given time period. Accountability refers to the feeling of responsibility for any work done. It enables the students to set and meet their goals in times of obstacles and pressure. They are able to manage themselves. Social and Cross Cultural Interaction These are the skills to communicate, work, collaborate in diverse social and cultural environments. It gives the students the opportunity to work with people of diverse background, behave respectfully and build a healthy team environment. 21st century skills in the students are required not only because they have to face the problems of 21st century but also because they are able to learn completely and comprehensively only when they can become excellent citizens and are able to perform and fulfil their responsibilities towards themselves, society and towards the nation. The goal of teaching 21st century skills is to enable the student's potential by making them responsible human beings who are well aware of their competence and abilities. Studying for exams is not going to be enough for the 21st century. It will not help the students face everyday life situations of 21st century. These skills will be allowing the students to face their real life issues with an effective strategy. The growth and development of students in 21st century can be complete with these skills. These skills are also required to bridge the gender gap in schooling and employment where there are more opportunities for male students as compared to females and other genders. Children with special needs can be empowered with the help of these skills so that they can feel independent in their home, school and community environments. Because of the rapid economic, social change, schools have to prepare students for jobs that have not yet been created, technologies that are still emerging and problems that humans don't yet know and understand. These skills will also support the young and vulnerable adolescent population so that they can develop themselves fully, cope up with risky situations and manage daily life pressure. Dimensions of 21st Century Skills 21st century skills in the students requires them to build awareness in Global issues, be financially, economically literate, have civic literacy, health and environmental literacy. These dimensions can be explained as Global Awareness 21st century requires a student to be aware of the global cultures and he/she should learn to work in collaboration with people from diverse cultures, countries and religion. They should understand the specific needs of people from different cultures. Financial and Economic Literacy Students must be able to make appropriate personal economic decisions concerning them. They should know the role of their country's economy in everyday life so that it will enhance productivity and their career. Civic Literacy Students should be responsible citizens and shall effectively participate in civic life. They should exercise their rights and duties and understand the national and international importance of their civic decisions. Health Literacy Students should be aware and understand about basic health, safety and services that will improve health. They should be able to fully understand holistic well-being, including proper diet, nutrition, exercise and be stress free. They should be able to monitor personal health goals. Environmental Literacy Students should be aware of the impact of everyday life actions, like rising pollution, population on the environment. They should investigate and analyse issues affecting environment to reach out at solutions. They should be able to collectively act for addressing issues related to natural environment. The world is changing of a face pace. We are supplying our students with skills that are not sufficient to address modern problems. Today due to rapidly changing economy, society, environment, technology, students are required to upgrade themselves and be ready for the current situations they face as well as those scenarios that they have never faced. Teachers should encourage their students to take on collaborative projects, engage them in extra-curricular activities and teach them to collaborate with their peers. Inculcating these new age skills in our students will require participation of teachers, government, parents, educators, technology creators and most importantly, the students themselves.",      
    "Topic10": "India has a long history of holistic education. Education in ancient India was concerned not just with the acquisition of knowledge for living life in this world, but for complete realisation and liberation of the self from the worldly shackles Education in India got enriched through the mixing of cultures that came to India from the invasions, till the arrival of the British. Realising the value of education as an important tool in life building and character building, after independence several initiatives were taken and are still being taken in the arena of education. Education has the power to make the world a better place. It is a tool to achieve prosperity, development, empowerment, freedom and self-reliance. It helps to develop foundational cognitive skills of literacy and numeracy, higher order cognitive skills of critical thinking and problem solving and soft skills of cultural Awareness, empathy, perseverance, grit, teamwork and leadership. If the education becomes inclusive, it becomes one of the most effective tools to promote a vibrant and tolerant society. The world is undergoing rapid changes. There is a sizeable shift in the understanding of the world with the emergence of big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence etc. The present world problems call for expertise in multiple disciplines. These disciplines particularly involve mathematics, computer science, data science in conjunction with subjects like humanities, social science etc. With the quickly changing employment and global ecosystem, it becomes increasingly important for the children to be creative, multi-disciplinary, and be adaptive and innovative. The New Education Policy has been launched to provide accessible, equitable, and affordable education to all without any discrimination and consideration of their socio-economic background Principles of the New Education Policy The New Education Policy of 2020 is based on the following principles Flexibility It seeks to provide flexibility for learners to choose their learning trajectory and choose their path according to their own talents. Multi-Disciplinary To provide holistic education across all spectrums such as science, social sciences, arts, humanities, sports etc. Ethical and Constitutional Values aims to inculcate values of empathy, respect for others, cleanliness, etiquette, scientific temper, liberty, responsibility, equality and justice. Equity and Inclusion It will be the aim of all educational decisions, to ensure that all the students are able to thrive in the education system. All the teachers and educators will be recruited through rigorous preparation. There will be emphasis on preparation, continuous professional development, positive working environment and service development. Integrity and Transparency It seeks to insure a transparent educational system while ensuring innovation and out of the box ideas through autonomy, good governance and empowerment. Continuous Policy Making to be based on regular assessments of realities on the ground taking into account India's rich, diverse, ancient and modern culture and knowledge systems and tradition. Life Skills Focussing on building life skills such as cooperation, teamwork. Communication, resilience etc. Education as Fundamental Right - Education is a public service and not a commercial activity. It should be available to all with adequate quality. There shall be strong and sustainable investments in a vibrant public education system as well as an ethical and philanthropic private system. Thus, with the application of these principles, the policy aims to build a globally excellent education system rooted in Indian ethos and aligned with the goal of a brilliant India. This will transform India into a global super power. Components of the New Education Policy aims to introduce several changes in the Indian education system from school to the college level. It includes revamping the following systems of education. The policy states that 85% of a child's brain development occurs prior to the age of 6 years. Thus, early childhood learning is of utmost priority. Early childhood care and education is the need of the hour. This early education and care will consist of flexible, multi-faceted, multi-level, play based, activity based and discovery based learning. It will develop motor skills, social-emotional, ethical skills and development of communication and early language skills. The current system of 10+2 after the early education will be replaced by a new 5+3-3+4 curriculum structure. Now, the children in age group of 3 to 8 years will spend 5 year for foundational stage in preschool education and class 1st and 2nd Three years will be spent at preparatory stage in classes 3 to 5. 3 years will further be spent at middle stages in classes 6 to 8. Four years will be in secondary stage for classes 9 to 12. Co-curriculum and vocational subjects such as sports, arts, commerce and science will be treated at the same level. Students will be allowed to take up coding from class 6 onwards to improve their computer skills. Vocational education will also be given a push with internships from class 6. The exams of class 10th and 12th will be made easier to test competencies rather than memorise facts with all the students allowed to take the exam twice. The curriculum content is set to be reduced in classes and there will be focus upon critical thinking, and more discovery based, inquiry based and analysis based learning. A new and comprehensive National Curriculum Framework for teacher education will be formulated for improving teacher capabilities. The policy provides that medium of instruction in schools shall be the mother language till atleast class 5th but preferably till class 8th and beyond. This will improve learning at the school level and children will be better able to understand the subjects that they will study. The rate of dropouts from school education will also be reduced and curtailed with overhaul in the curriculum to make it more engaging and to students in the vernacular medium. For those who have dropout from schools, overall initiatives will be taken in order to bring them back. In higher education, the gross enrolment ratio will be raised to 50% by 2035 from the current 26.3%. The policy also provides for a multi-disciplinary higher education framework with portable credits and multiple exits with certificates, diploma and degrees. The aim of university education will be to develop good, well rounded and creative individuals. It proposes a higher education system consisting of large, multi-disciplinary universities and colleges with atleast one in every district. It proposes increased access to higher education through open schooling, online education and open distance learning - It seeks to end the fragmentation of higher education institutions and turn them into large multi-disciplinary universities. A comprehensive education system in the higher education institutions in which even the engineering institutions such as IITs will move towards more arts and humanities and students of arts and humanities learning more science so that education becomes more holistic. Departments in languages, literature, music, philosophy, ideology, art, dance, theatre, education, statistics, pure and applied sciences, sociology, economics, sports etc. will be setup in higher education institutions to give education a comprehensive and holistic dimension. The National Research foundation will be created as an apex body for fostering a strong research culture and building research capacity across higher education. Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) will be setup as a single umbrella body for entire higher education excluding medical and legal education. College affiliation system will be phased out in 15 years and a stage-wise mechanism will be established for granting graded autonomy to colleges. Over a period of time, every college will develop into an autonomous degree granting college or a constituent college of a university. Multiple mechanisms with checks and balances will be established to stop commercialisation of higher education. All the educational institutions will be audited as per standards of audit. The private higher education institutions will be encouraged which have philanthropic and public spirited intent. Literacy and basic education opens up a whole new world of personal, civic, economic and lifelong learning opportunities for individuals that enable them to progress personally and professionally. An outstanding adult education curriculum framework will be developed by a new and well supported institution under NCERT. The curriculum will focus on foundational literacy and numeracy, critical life skills, such as health awareness, childcare, family welfare, vocational skill development, basic education, and holistic education courses in arts, science, technology, culture, sports, recreation etc. A suitable infrastructure will be ensured so that all interested adults will have access to education. Setting up of public libraries, which will be equipped with information and communication technology will be undertaken. A national literacy mission will be started to mobilise community organisations and volunteers in order to achieve large scale adult literacy and education outcomes. Government will work closely with NGOs and other community organisations and support them as necessary. The preservation and promotion of India's cultural wealth will be considered as high priority for the country. Cultural awareness is important for the individual as well in order to provide him with a sense of identity, belonging, as well as an appreciation of other cultures and identities. Initiatives will be taken from pre-primary level through the higher education level for exposing the students to Indian music, arts, crafts and languages. An accurate account of traditional Indian knowledge across humanities, sciences, arts and crafts and other sports will be undertaken. India will also expand its institutes and universities studying all classical languages and literature with strong efforts to collect, preserve, translate and study the tens of thousands of manuscripts from ancient India. All languages in India and their associated art, culture will be documented via a web based platform/portal/wiki in order to preserve endangered and all vulnerable Indian languages and their associated rich local arts and culture. The platform will contain videos, dictionaries, recordings, poetry, folk songs etc. to preserve them. Further, a new body known as National Education Alliance for Technology (NEAT) will be setup to provide a platform for the use of technology to enhance learning. Assessment, planning, administration for both school and higher education. It aims to create rich software for students and teachers so that education reaches all new technologies such as Al (Artificial Intelligence) will be used in fields of research with strong data backed framework. This will fulfil the needs and demands of 21st century students and the teachers. How will it Improve Education in India? The New Education Policy will give importance to student's practical knowledge and skills instead of pushing them towards rote learning. It is going to help the students develop scientific temper from a very young age. It will have the following benefits It is going to focus upon universalising access from early childhood to higher education, integrating over two crore out of school children and aims to provide education to even the socio-economically disadvantaged children. Improving early access to education and childcare will strengthen the foundations of children's education and make them better humans. A strong foundation will also help the young children in adapting and learning quickly. Teacher education will be given a push. It will ensure that the right teachers teach the students. Comprehensive review of teacher training will ensure that teaching capabilities are enhanced, which in turn will enhance the learning outcomes. • Increasing technology use will be able to bridge the gap in the existing system students who were not able to get access to education will be connected to education system with the help of technology. Technology will also aim to defy the traditional barriers of caste, class, society, occupation etc. The policy seeks to deregulate the institutions and remove bureaucratic shackles. It will give more autonomy to the educational institutions which will improve their efficiency and delivery of education. It will improve the quality of institutions everywhere across the country. Universities will be able to introduce new courses without going through cumbersome regulatory processes Adult education is going to develop at a faster pace. Vocational education for adults will enable them to get incorporated in the new world which requires learning of new skills for a better and prosperous future. The focus on learning through mother tongue will lead to intensive development of children at an early age. They will be able to relate to the local culture, geography, history and local arts. This will enable them to become good learners. It will increase their capacity of learning and understanding. The New Education Policy is a step in the right direction. It focuses on critical thinking, experiential learning, interactive classroom, integrated pedagogy, and competency based education. Inclusive digital education serves as an empowering component of the policy. If investments in the education system will be made and all the states cooperate in fulfilling the aspirations mentioned in the policy, India will be able to reap the benefits of its young demography. NEP could shape the future of education across India. Through a robust education system, India will take a giant step towards establishing itself as a knowledge superpower.",

    "Topic12": "The past two decades have witnessed an invasion by technology in almost all the spheres of human life. This has led to an increased dependency on technology. Thanks to information technology, the world is making paradigm shifts from the offline to the online domain. Everything from banking, stock exchange, healthcare, education can be controlled and monitored using technology. As there are two sides of a coin, the technology also has two sides to it i.e. its pros and cons. One of the major cons of the technology is cyber-crime. Cyber-crime is defined as a crime in which a computer is the object of the crimes such as, hacking, phishing, spamming or is used as a tool to commit an offense (child pornography, hate crimes). Cyber criminals may use computer technology to access personal information, business trade secrets or use the interment for malicious purposes such as online monitoring of another person's activities, unauthorised users who can access their personal and sensitive information. A person who gains unauthorised access to the system is known as a hacker. Theft involves the download of copyrighted material by violating the copyrights. In the case of electronic fund transfer crime, a person illegally gains access to another person's bank details and this may lead to financial losses. E-mail bombing involves sending a large number of mails over the network in order to crash the server. A very common cyber-crime act is sending the virus as an attachment via mails. This virus can be used to extract the data from the system and jeopardise it in some cases. National and international financial people tend to share a lot over the social media platforms. This information is used by cyber criminals to extract personal and sensitive information of others which can be misused later on. The imposters create fake social media accounts and post misleading information about the e concerned person. This commonly happens with public figures and is done with an intention to malign and harm the image of the person. In this world dominated by technology, smartphones have become imperative. The smartphones have given way to mobile applications. A large number of private and public sector banks, e-commerce websites, railways and airlines have launched their mobile applications. The ease of operations of smartphone applications prompts the users to install and operate them. With millions of users, these applications are a lucrative source of data. Many times, the users unknowingly grant certain permissions to the application, which allows it to access their personal information. This gives the application provider with personal information about the individual. 30, the user needs to be careful while installing mobile applications and be sure of the permissions granted to them. India is taking giant strides towards digitalisation with initiatives such as 'Digital India'. This necessitates the people to learn to tackle with the different aspects of cyber-crime. Although, people have become tech-savvy, their knowledge about cyber-crime is limited. The cyber-crime needs to be dealt at two levels-one will be at the individual level and the other will be at the service provider level. People need to be very careful about their acquaintances and the degree to which they divulge their personal information on social media. It is best to stay away and not accept invites, as well as requests, from unknown people. One should avoid sharing sensitive information such as passwords with anyone the passwords need to be strong enough so that the hacker cannot crack them. In order to increase the strength of the password, one can make use of alpha-numeric values and special symbols. In fact, one needs to make sure that there is never a common password for all accounts. It is best to refrain from clicking on the pop-ups and unknown website links. One needs to make sure that all the transactions that are done online happen through a secured gateway. One must abstain from saving the bank account details on the websites. The mails which make claims about winning prize money are malicious and must be ignored. A good quality anti-virus must be installed in the system. This anti-virus must be regularly updated E-mail service providers as well as many other online platforms, have started multi-step verification process in order to secure the user's account It is always better to spend some extra amount of time and go in for the verification in order to secure one's account. The service provider can encrypt the data in order to protect it. Encryption is a technique to convert plain text into cipher text. Cipher text is the coded text and it is only the recipient of the data who can decrypt it using a special private key. ",      
    "Topic13": "Cloning is the process of producing an organism that is an exact replica of the parent. The organism thus produced is known as a clone and is genetically identical to the parent. The process of cloning requires a mature somatic (except sperms and egg) cell from the body of the parent animal. In the case of normal reproduction event, half of the DNA is from father and half is from the mother which induces the variations in an individual and as a result creates the individual, who has its own unique DNA. The process of cloning requires the removal of a somatic cell from the body of the parent and this cell is the source of DNA for the clone. As the probability of sexual reproduction is ruled out, the probability of variation is also ruled out and this results in producing an exact replica or clone of the individual parent the cloned egg is allowed to mature into the early embryonic stage before it is implanted in the womb of a female for gestation. The individual who is born out of this process is known as a clone. There are two types of cloning namely therapeutic and reproductive. The only difference between the two is that the embryo is not transferred in the womb 0f the mother in the therapeutic cloning. The sheep, Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned. Proponents of human cloning swear by the advantages it will offer to the humans' Scientists are of the opinion that they can reverse the ageing process, as well as the heart attacks. Heart attack victims can be treated by cloning and injecting 0f healthy cells in the areas of the heart that have been damaged. This will lead to shortening of the organ donation list and save more lives. In fact, the chances of rejection will be less in such cases as this will not be recognised as a foreign body by the human body. Embryonic stem cells' can be used to produce organs, tissues or repair the damaged ones. Skin, brain, hearts, lungs and kidneys etc. can be produced utilising these cells. Conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease can also be cured with the help of cloning. Cloning can be helpful in genetics. The scientists can gather a better understanding of the genes their patterns, and effects on human traits. This could be helpful in doing away with many genetic diseases. With cloning at their hands, researchers can easily clone the organism as per their requirements of research. These organisms could be used for the purpose of research. The process of '~ healing and recovery would also be narrowed down with the use of the ' individual's own cell. Reproductive cloning is helpful for the childless couples. The infertile individuals who have lost their ability to produce reproductive cells can experience the joy of parenthood. In fact, same sex couples can have children through this method. The clones of endangered animals can be created to increase their population. Although the scientists were successful in creating clones from the skin cells of infants and human beings, none of these embryos were allowed to mature. A number of ethical concerns overpower the same. In the case of reproductive cloning, one of the major concerns is that the children will be designed and replicated as per the parents' wish. This will lead to the lack of uniqueness among the children. This, in turn, will give rise to the concerns regarding the human individuality and freedom. Another important ethical concern is that the children living under the shadow of their genetic donor will always be expected to live up to the images of the persons from whom they were Created Religious groups are of the opinion that cloning is against God creation and nature, as the clone would be created by man. Cloning research requires. Every month, a normal healthy woman usually produces one or two mature eggs. But, in order to increase the number significantly, doses of stimulatory medications which are used in IVF procedures must be given to the woman. In rare cases, these drugs can provoke a hyper stimulation syndrome that can lead to liver damage, kidney failure or stroke. Such drugs are known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. In fact, the surgery to retrieve the eggs also has risks associated with it. In case the woman is offered commercial benefits for providing eggs, the value of the human reproductive material is restricted to a commodity. , While on one hand cloning of body organs can be helpful in organ replacement, there is a chance that people may deliberately reproduce other individuals with undesired traits. This will lead to the increase in malpractices in the society",      
    "Topic14": "The Arab-Israeli conflict is a struggle between the Jewish state of Israel and the Arabs of the Middle East. It has continued for many decades and there has been no peaceful solution so far. Many religions look upon the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea as their homeland. This historic land is called Palestine. Before the birth of Christ, the Jews also lived here. Later on, the Romans invaded the area and made it Christian. The Jews were driven away and had to live in other parts of the world. Muslims also think of Palestine as a holy place. In the Middle Ages the land was ruled by the Turks of the Ottoman Empire and more and more Arabs came to Palestine. In the middle of the 19th century, Jews started to think about coming back to Palestine. This idea was called Zionism. By the beginning of the 20th century, more and more Jews came back to Palestine and started a new life there. At the end of World War I the Turks were defeated and Great Britain ruled Palestine. The British helped the Jews and wanted to create a new country for them. During the Second World War about 6 million Jews were murdered by German Nazis in the Holocaust. Those who survived had no place to go. In 1947, the United Nations decided to divide Palestine into two states: Israel for the Jews and Palestine for the Arabs. The Jews accepted the plan but the Arabs didn't want the Jews to take over their country. When the British left Palestine in 1948, Israel declared its independence. At once, Arab countries started to attack the new state but Israel fought back and won. It also expanded its territory and occupied more land than the UN gave it. Other Arab countries ‘Egypt, Syria and Jordan’ took over the Arab part of Palestine. Over 700,000 Palestinians became refugees. Most of them fled to Israel's neighbours. Since the war of 1948, Israel has had to fight three more wars against its Arab neighbours. In 1956 Egypt took control of the Suez Canal from Great Britain and France. Together with Israel, these two countries attacked Egypt and, for a short time, Israel took control of the Sinai Peninsula. In May 1967, Egypt's president Nasser prepared for another attack on Israel. He closed Israel's only route to the sea and soldiers from all the Arab countries marched to Israel's border. However, Israel attacked first and surprised its enemies. In a war that lasted only six days, Israel defeated the Arabs and took over some of their land: The fourth and last war took place in October 1973. It surprised Israel because Egypt and Syria attacked on Yom Kippur, one of Israel's holiest days. Israel fought back and defeated the Arabs once again. They took control of the Sinai Peninsula, but gave it back to Egypt two years later. In the late 1970s Egypt saw that it could not win a war against Israel, so it became the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish state. In 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon, its northern neighbour. The PLO, an organisation thought fought for the rights of the Palestinians, continued to attack Israel from southern Lebanon. Israel's soldiers stayed in Lebanon until 2000. Towards the end of the 1980's Palestinians in the occupied lands started to protest against Israel's rule. This was known as the first Intifada. There were demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Arabs stopped working for Israelis and some towns stopped paying taxes to the Israeli government. Israel had to use more and more force to get these territories under control. At the beginning of the 1990s, the PLO realized that its only hope was to make peace with Israel. In 1993 an agreement was signed between the PLO and Israel. The PLO recognised Israel's right to exist and Israel promised to give back some of the land that it took away in 1967. It also agreed to talks on a Palestinian state. By the end of the century, more and more land was given back to the Palestinians and they also set up their own government in these areas. But when the peace talks slowed down in 2000, the second Intifada began. Palestinian suicide bombers started blowing themselves up in Israeli towns, killing many Israelis. In return, Israel's army took control of most parts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Today, lasting peace is farther away than ever before, because there are extremists on both sides who don't want to live together peacefully. During the second Intifada Israel sent soldiers to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They started building a fence around the occupied territories. In 2006 Hezbollah, an extremist group took control of Lebanon, Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and rocket attacks were launched against northern Israel. As retaliation Israel invaded Lebanon to stop the attacks. In the Gaza Strip Hamas, another paramilitary organization has become more powerful and today controls the Gaza Strip. It started launching attacks against Israel. Israel reacted by sending more troops into the area. The Palestine Liberation Organisation is a political group that fights for the rights of the Arab people in Palestine. Its main goal is to create an independent state for these people. Today there are more than 4 million people who live in the lands that are occupied by Israel. The PLO is made up of people from all social classes’ doctors, lawyers and teachers and, of course, people from the working classes. There are also radical members, who hate the Israelis and don't want to live in peace with them. The PLO was founded in 1964. Yassir Arafat was their leader for over 35 years. He died in 2004. The organisation has never had a real home. Over the years they have been in Jordan and Lebanon, but they are not very welcome anywhere. Today, the PLO controls some parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where they also have their own government. In the past few years Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas has had problems controlling groups that want to destroy Israel. Radical Palestinians put bombs on their bodies and blow themselves up in crowded areas.",      
    "Topic15": "An atom is the smallest building block of everything that exists. The smallest object you can see under a microscope has more than 10 billion atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atoms, that we call elements. They form the world we live in. Well known elements are hydrogen, oxygen, iron or lead. When two elements get together they form a compound. For example, water has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Atoms all have about the same size, but they have different weights. Plutonium is one of the heaviest atoms, about 200 times heavier than hydrogen, which is the lightest element. An atom consists of three parts: protons, neutrons, electrons. Protons and neutrons are in the center of an atom, which is called the nucleus. It is very small if you compare it with the whole atom and it has almost all of an atom's mass. If an atom had a diameter of about 6 km the nucleus would only be as big as a tennis ball. The rest of the atom outside the nucleus is mostly empty. Electrons fly around in an atom very, very quickly. They have almost no mass and travel around the nucleus millions of times every second. The parts of an atom have electrical charges. Each proton carries a positive electrical charge and each electron has a negative electrical charge. Neutrons have no charge. In most cases an atom has the same number of protons and electrons. It is electrically neutral. The energy of the nucleus keeps the electron inside the atom just like the Earth keeps the moon in its orbit. But electrons have energy themselves. They want to break away from the nucleus. If an electron has a lot of energy it moves around farther away from the nucleus. Electrons move around the nucleus in up to seven round paths, called shells. The first shell is closest to the nucleus. It can hold two electrons. The second shell can hold 8, the third 18 and the fourth 32 electrons. In most atoms, the outer shells are never completely filled with electrons. The inner electrons travel fastest; the outer ones are the slowest. The atomic number tells you how many protons an atom has. For example, every hydrogen atom has the atomic number 1 because it only has 1 proton. Elements that have atomic numbers of up to 92 can be found in nature; those over 92 are created by scientists in a laboratory. The atomic number tells us where we can find an element in the periodic table. This table shows all the atoms in groups. The atomic mass is the number of portions and neutrons in an atom. Although all atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, they sometimes have more neutrons. Such atoms are called isotopes. For example, hydrogen has three isotopes. Most of the time a hydrogen atom has one proton and one neutron. Sometimes you can find hydrogen isotopes that have two or three neutrons, but they too have only one proton. In lighter elements the nucleus of each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. But heavier elements have more neutrons than protons. Uranium, for example has 92 protons and 146 neutrons. Its atomic mass is 238. The atomic mass is never a whole number, because scientists do not just add protons and neutrons together. They use a complicated formula. Normally, an atom is electrically neutral. But it can gain or lose electrons when it crashes with other atoms. Atoms that gain or lose electrons are called ions. They have an electric charge. Atoms that lose electrons become positive ions; atoms that win electrons become negative ions. In some atoms the nucleus can change naturally. Such an atom is radioactive. When a nucleus changes it produces rays. In nature, there are some elements that are radioactive, like uranium or radium. In labs scientists can produce radioactivity by bombarding atoms with smaller particles. In the 1930s and 40s scientists found out that if they bombarded a uranium atom with a neutron the nucleus would split up into two parts. When this happens energy is set free. We call this nuclear fission. Fission was first used in atomic bombs that the Americans dropped over Japan to end the Second World War. The bombs released so much energy that they killed hundreds of thousands of people. Later on scientists found out how this energy could be used in a peaceful way. In the 1950s the first atomic reactors were built. They produced energy by splitting atoms. Compounds are groups of two or more elements that are tied together. They are created when two different atoms share the same electron or when electrons travel from one atom to another. Every compound has certain features and a chemical formula. Water, for example, is a compound that has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in it. Its chemical formula is H 2O. When sodium (Na) combines with chlorine (Cl) you get a compound called salt (NaCl). Carbon and hydrogen atoms form methane, or natural gas (CH 4). Compounds can be divided into two groups: organic compounds always have carbon atoms in them. You can find them in all living creatures, in plants and in a lot of our food, for example sugar and fat. All other compounds are called inorganic compounds. Compounds can be solids, liquids or gases. They may also turn into many different colours. Some compounds react very quickly, others don't react at all.",      
    "Topic16": "Healthcare has become one of India's largest sectors. It comprises of hospitals medical devices, medical tourism, medical insurance etc. The healthcare providers are divided into public as well as private services. The public healthcare that involves government services is present as tertiary and secondary healthcare facilities and primary health centres in rural areas. Lack of adequate and quality healthcare services in Public sector forces people to move to the private sector services that are very costly and involves huge out of pocket expenditure. Several schemes have been run by different State Governments to improve healthcare services for various sections of services that were until now not available to them, but still various deficiencies exist. To fulfil these deficiencies in the public health sector, the Prime Minister on the occasion of Independence Day announced the launching of a National Digital Health ID. It will be a digital identification method that will contain the records of the health related information which could be easily shared with health authorities with a patient's consent. All the stakeholders such as hospitals, laboratories, insurance companies, telemedicine firms etc. will be expected to participate in the health ID system. A national digital health Id is a unique Id that will be assigned to every person which will identify the person, authenticate them and keep their health records for his/her medical history with the consent of the patient. It will allow for a seamless flow of health information across various systems for better service delivery to the patient. A health Id will be created by using the basic details and mobile or Aadhar number which will be unique to that person. At present, digital health Id has been announced in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadar and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Ladakh. Lakshadweep and Pondicherry. Apart from the patient's health information repository, the program will also include Digi Doctor. It will be a comprehensive data gathering platform of all doctors that are currently practising or teaching modern/traditional system of medicine. It will allow the doctors to get connected to India's digital health ecosystem. Health Facility Registry It is a comprehensive record of health facilities across the country it will include both public and private health facilities including hospitals, clinics, diagnostics, laboratories, pharmacies etc. Electronic Medical Records It will be a digital version of patient's treatment history from a single facility. The health information recorded in a facility will be stored locally at the establishment where the patient was registered. This information will be linked to patient's health Id. Deficiencies in the healthcare system of India include inadequate reach of basic healthcare services, shortage of trained medical professionals, lack of quality services etc. It is necessary to find ways to use technology in health services to improve delivery of services and provide truly universal access to every citizen. But these objectives are not fulfilled due to various reasons. These are 1. Low Priority to Public Health Keeping communities - healthy through prevention of diseases and promotion of health and wellness has been a low priority historically in India. Of all the current expenditure on health, preventive care only accounts for 6.7% whereas curing people involves more expenditure as it involves other expenses such as pharmaceuticals, other medical goods and transportation India, accounting for 18% of global population accounted for 36% of global tuberculosis and 26% of premature mortality due to diarrhoea, and a range of non-communicable diseases. 2. Limited Training In most states - public health management positions are taken over by doctors, that are trained mainly in the provision of curative services or by generalist civil servants They have limited public health training to understand the cause and effect between risk factors and diseases as well as disciplines such as epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioural sciences and management of health services Hospitals in rural areas are run by clinicians that have little expertise in managing health facilities. 3. The existing primary healthcare model is limited in scope. Services that are provided in these primary centres are only the services related to childcare, womencare, motherhood and certain services related to national health and schemes. These account for very low proportion of the essential services that people demand for their welfare and wellbeing and to prevent morbidity Thus, there is no provision for services such as hypertension, heart disease, adolescent health, mental health, disability, ageing health, and early cancer detection. 4. Low Workforce in Healthcare - India's healthforce is characterised by a diversity of healthcare workers in fields of allopathy, alternative systems of medicine such as ayurveda, homeopathy, anani and siddha. The doctor-population ratio in Inda is 1:1613. The nurse-population ratio is 1.1588. This is very low as compared to developed countries. The distribution of existing workforce is concentrated in urban areas. Urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as in rural areas. As medical and nursing colleges are concentrated in Southern states, these conditions also increase the inequality in availability of trained medical healthcare providers Apart from this, there is also shortage of allied health professionals such as lab technicians, radiologists etc. 5. Increasing Cost of Medical Services - For various medical tourists India is an appropriately favourable destination for world class cheap healthcare but for Indians, healthcare has become increasingly expensive, remaining out of reach of many people. The price of treatment has risen at double the speed of rise in income as per the NSSO surveys Many private establishments overcharge patient and also recommend unnecessary tests This further raises the costs of hospitalisation and out of pocket expenditure. 6. Lack of Standardisation - Different healthcare organisations have varying software supplies, depending of their size of working, management system and infrastructure. There is no standardisation in the delivery of healthcare This creates confusions among the doctors when a patient moves from one health institution to another Moreover, several patients are asked to start fresh treatment if they have switched from one doctor to another. Many initiatives have been launched by the government in India such as the National Digital Health Blueprint, National Health Stack etc. These aim to overhaul India's existing healthcare ecosystem. They seek to digitise health records so that patients do not have to carry their lab reports, prescriptions etc. in physical form and digital records are available to them at their convenience. The digital records can also be shared with any doctor or family member with the patient's consent. In this direction, the NITI Aayog proposed a nation-wide framework to digitise the healthcare in India, in the form of a National Health Stack. The National Digital Health ID is one of a horizontal component of the National Health Stack, which was announced by the Prime Minister from the ramparts of the Red Fort in his Independence Day speech. The components of the framework proposed by NITI Aayog include 1. An electronic national health registry that would serve as a single source of health data for whole country. 2. An insurance claim platform that will allow the expansion of existing health schemes such as Ayushman Bharat. 3. A personal health record system that would enable the patients to access their own health data as well as access by doctors 4. A national health analytics platform that would provide a holistic view by combining various health initiatives to improve policymaking. 5. Other components such as a unique digital health Id. How will these digital initiatives improve healthcare in India? Technology based initiatives will revolutionalise the set of public as well as private healthcare system in India It will provide following benefits for the healthcare.  The digitisation of medically critical information will help the doctors in diagnosing the patient easily. The doctor will have access to the current and previous diagnostics, current and previous diseases, medical reports, prescription discharge summaries, etc. It will reduce the time involved in the initial diagnosis and provide the patient with better quality healthcare services. Patients will be able to access health services remotely with the help of teleconsultations, e-pharmacies, online appointments etc. Patients will be able to access this information on a mobile app. This will reduce the inequality between rural and urban in the availability of health services. It is going to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the health service delivery. Patients will be able to share their health records and history with the medical services providers quickly with the click of a mouse. This is going to reduce diagnostic and treatment time for critically ill patients who are in urgent need of care. Better quality of health data is going to be most beneficial for policy makers that will enable the government in forming better policies even for a particular region. It can be used to monitor the healthcare of India both geographically as well as demographically. This will strengthen government program implementation. Preventive healthcare will be strengthened because if an elaborate database about the prevalent diseases will be available to the government it will be in a better position to form policies and programs to establish, run and monitor the primary health centres to the preventive health needs of citizen. Research and development will greatly benefit from the availability of such aggregated information as there will be critical evaluation of effectiveness of various programs and policies by the government. There will a good network of feedback between researchers, policy makers and providers. Data will also be used by the private players securely to further improve their own services so that the vast number of patients associated with the private health facilities will able to access better services at cheaper costs. This will also improve access to healthcare because private healthcare accounts for majority of healthcare providers in India. All these high and tall promises cannot be fulfilled without addressing the Concerns associated with the privacy and data of the patient. There has been a little movement in the data protection framework of India Medical health data is very critical if it is not handled carefully, it will lead to invasion of privacy and other related issues with the patients. Further, the government will need to incentivise the hospitals, clinics, patients etc. so that they adopt the new technologies as it will require significant investments in technology setup and operation of the digital system. There must be standardisation across all the systems so that it does not become confusing to the patient as well as the services provider. The system will also be required to be error free as updating of data on the server involves significant errors that intern may affect patient health. Apart from this, government will also be required to regulate the use of private data by the private players so that it is not misused. Thus, all these concerns if addressed and provide significant gains to healthcare in India and health of Indians.",      
    "Topic17": "On 5th August, 2019, by virtue of the Presidential Order 2019, Article 370 pertaining to provisions of the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated. With this action, the Government of India revoked the special status or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitute to Jammu and Kashmir. Following the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian Union on 26th October, 1947, the Maharaja Hari Singh who had ruled Jammu and Kashmir earlier handed over control of defence, external affairs and communications to Government of India Article 170 and the accompanying Constitutional Order of 1950 formalised this relationship In 1952, the Governments of the State and e Union agreed that Indian citizenship would be extended to all the residents of the state but the state would be empowered to legislate over the rights and privileges of the state's subjects, who would now be called 'permanent residents Article 370 of the Indian Constitution gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir by conferring it with the power to lure a separate Constitution. A state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state. Article 37 was included in the section of the Constitution on temporary, transitional and special provisions The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir after its establishment was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian Constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate Article 370 altogether. Presidential Order was issued in 1954 which specified the articles of the Indian Constitution that applied to the state as part of this order. Article 35A was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privilege of permanent residents of the state. The state of Jammu and Kashmir defined these privileges to include the ability to purchase land and immovable property, ability to vote and contest elections, seeking government employment and availing other state benefits such as higher education and healthcare Non-permanent residents of the state, even if they were Indian citizens, were not entitled to these privileges. Later, as the state's Constituent Assembly dissolved it without recommending the abrogation of Article 370 the article was understood to have bee permanent feature of the Indian Constitution. However, Clouse 3 of the Article 370 gives the President of India the power to amend its provisions and scope. In subsequent years, the provisions of Article 170 were diluted though various presidential orders to allow more subjects to be controlled by the Union Government which had earlier been applicable to the mate govern of J and Kashmir. In each case, the concurrence of the State Assembly was taken before issuing the Presidential order. In various court cases over the years, the Supreme Court of India had always upheld that Clause 1 of Article 370 cannot be modified or deleted, as it states that it applies to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The reasons given by the Government of India for abrogation’s of Article 370 in August 2019, was that, it was only a temporary provision. Further, Article 370 was added in the Indian Constitution to provide autonomy to Jammu And Kashmir State. However, it failed to address the well-being of Kashmiris over the last 30 years, as they had been enduring generations of insurgency, violence and terrorism. It had also contributed to the gap between Kashmir and the rest of the nation. Other reasons, which the government did not spell out but which must have influenced its decision are related to international events in the neighbourhood The situation emerging in the Western neighbourhood, i.e. Pakistan and Afghanistan and the possible re-ascendance of the Taliban in Afghanistan, calls for greater attention and care in the Kashmir region. Further, the emerging geopolitical dynamics in Afghanistan and the resultant China-Pakistan relations could have potentially led to more heat on the Kashmir situation in the months ahead. Provisions of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019 Subsequent to the Constitutional Order of 5th August, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation.  Bill was introduced in Parliament. This bill has been passed and made applicable with effect from 31st October, 2019. Following are the some of provisions of this bill It divides the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two new Union Territories (UTS), Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Of the six Lok Sabha seats currently with the state of Jammu and Kashmir, five will remain with the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, while one will be allotted to Ladakh. The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, similar to those in Delhi and Pondicherry. The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly will have a five-year term, not six, as was the earlier case Section 32 of the Jammu and Kashmir Bill, 2019, proposes that the Assembly can make laws on any subjects in the State and Concurrent lists except on state subjects relating to public order' and 'police This is also similar to Article 239A of the Constitution that is applicable to Union Territories of Pondicherry and Delhi. However, in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the Assembly can make laws on land, which it cannot do in the case of Delhi. Accordingly, the special status provided to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 has been abolished. It will no longer have a separate Constitution, flag of anthem. The citizens of Jammu and Kashmir will not have dual citizenship. A the new Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir will be subject to the Indian Constitution, its citizens will now have the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Article 360, which can be used to declare a financial emergency, will now also be applicable. All laws passed by Parliament will be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir, including the Right to Information Act and the Right to Education Act. The Indian Penal Code will replace the Ranbir Penal Code of Jammu and Kashmir. Also, Article 35A, which originates from the provisions of Article 370, is now null and void. As the Presidential Order has extended all provisions of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, including the chapter on Fundamental Rights, the discriminatory provisions under Article 35A will now be unconstitutional. Article 370 has always been seen by the Kashmiris as a marker of their separate identity and autonomy. Thus, there is a possibility of widespread protests and violence as a reaction to the dilution of Article 370. Terror elements in Pakistan might find Kashmir to be the most fertile ground for breeding terrorism. The unrest can affect the democratic progress that has been made so far. Thus, the situation requires careful handling by the Government of India so as to create normalcy as early as possible. The union government must build trust with the people of Jammu and Kashmir. A sense of oneness will change the perception of people of Kashmir towards Indian government. Due attention should be given to address the socio-economic distress in rural areas. More democratic rights should be given to the people and political activities should be allowed to resume. Special focus should be given to educating and skilling the youth so that they do not feel alienated. The state should be restored to its past glory.",      
    "Topic18": "Indian online gaming industry has grown at an exponential rate over the past few years and it is expected to grow further with India's digital revolution. The beginning of online gaming industry in India is traced back to 2000s when PC gaming and console gaming brought several middle income group Indians on digital gaming platform. The international developers provided a base to the Indian gamers whereas the Indian gaming developer's ecosystem primarily acted as service providers. As India's smartphone user base and internet penetration increased, online gaming grew very fast with an estimated 120 million gamers online now. The key driver of growth in Indian online gaming industry has been the rapid increase in penetration of low cost smartphones among the rural and urban populations. There are now approximately 400 million smartphone users in India Though the internet penetration is low in India but it is expected to be about 53% of population in 2021. This growth will be further aided by new technologies at affordable costs, increase in local developer base etc. With this increasing internet availability and rising number of online gamers, there have been ill effects such as poor academic performance, adverse effects on health, neglect of other important activities in one's life. Online gaming also leads to cyber bullying as well as inculcates wrong values in young children. According to a study involving Google India, an average Indian gamer is below 24 years of age. Males make up most of the gamers as compared to females 83% of gamers are male and are concentrated in urban areas of the country. These people, under the influence of their peers, begin gaming. Another reason for initiating online gaming is playing for recreation and utilisation of time. Some people are also engaged in gaming for stress relief and social interaction. Mobile phones tend to be the most preferred gaming platform with 85% games played on mobile. The most preferred genre across Indian gamers are puzzle games, action games and adventure games Male gamers are concerned about data and memory consumption whereas female gamers seek regular upgrade. More than 60% of gamers play online games on budget smartphones. The following factors are responsible for rise in online gaming in India Internet Penetration India is the second largest online market in world with an estimated 650 million users in 2030. There has been a steady in internet penetration in Indian rural as well as urban areas as compared decade ago. The leading internet depth in terms of user base is in the capital of India, New Delhi and surrounding regions. This is due to cheap data costs as compared to the other countries; Internet has been used actively by all the age groups for different purposes. Further, the potential for addition of new users also remains immense. This has led to an exponential growth in online gaming. Income of middle class and upper middle class has increased considerably which has improved their standard of living. They are now able to spend more on leisure and spend their free time on such activities. Increased living standards and free time has attracted them towards online gaming which requires little investment in buying a smartphone and an active mobile internet connection. Increase in Smartphone Penetration India's smartphone base is estimated to reach 820 million in the next two years by 2022. There has been increase in number of smartphones in both rural and urban areas. This is due to the emergence of cheaper smartphones in the Indian markets. Smartphone penetration has increased to over 25% and it is much higher in the urban areas. Young India is demographically a young country with 50% of population below the age of 25 years and 65% below the age of 35 years. This age group is involved in online gaming and is more aware about the trends in smartphone and online gaming platforms. This younger population of India has made it possible for online gaming to take roots in India. New technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality are available in India at much cheaper rates as compared to earlier years. These technologies aid in online gaming and enhance the experience of gamers. Earlier international developers provided games to Indian gamers. But with growing skill level, Indian developers have emerged even on the global scale. Games have started to be made in India by local developers. Games with localised context and in vernacular languages have emerged. These games can be played even by those people who do not know English language, the main language in which games are developed. Now games can be played in Indian languages with incorporation of localised context that attracts more people towards these games. Most of the games in the gaming ecosystem are free to play. Users have to pay no charges to download and play games. The emergence of premium games has further aided the development of the gaming ecosystem in India. In this concept, the games are free to play but for some premium features the user has to pay to the developer. This does not deprive those users who want to download and play free games only without buying the premium version. Gaming addiction involves various physical and mental effects. The harmful effects of gaming addiction are Financial Effects Though games are mainly free to play but they include various premium features that are paid. The gamers purchase the premium features in order to progress more in the game. The young people often spend huge amounts of their revenue for purchasing the premium content. Many platforms also require information of debit and credit card even to download free games. Young people who get access to these credit or debit cards often purchase the applications without their parent's consent. This, in extreme cases leads to overburdening debts and in many cases even friendly frauds with the young children. One of the major effects on the youth is impact on other areas of life. It affects the personal growth as young people are not able to concentrate on their studies or on their profession. People may feel bored; find it difficult to concentrate and feel demotivated in their educational or professional life Exposure to violent graphic or sexual content also has emotionally bad effects on young people. It leads to violent behaviour and daily life aggression over petty things. This also affects the personal growth of people because they often feel frustrated with themselves. Gaming addiction hinders social interactions as people are busy in gaming while ignoring their relations. Reduced interaction in social lives is dangerous for both physical as well as mental health. Addicted gamers often suffer strained relationships. They often take socially destructive decisions as they prioritise gaming above all other life activities. After finishing their gaming sessions, they do not find time and sufficient energy to invest in their relations. Mental health is severely affected due to addiction gaming. It induces anger or rage and young people often shout, scream or even physically attack their relatives or peers. Also, there is strong sense of urgency to return to gaming as soon as one finishes some other daily life task such as eating or doing home or office work. The people also feel isolated or lonely as they spend long times playing games without any interaction. Often the younger gamer feel depressed as they have to withdraw from playing games due to various reasons. People who continuously play games for longer hours suffer from stiffness, back aches, pain; numbness Eye strain is common if one looks at the screen for longer times without any breaks. People often play games sitting in poor postures that also lead to complex stress and strains that are difficult to diagnose with common techniques, Gaming addiction also makes the life of people sedentary because people miss out of their regular exercise and even their regular meals. They also indulge in poor and hygienic activities such as eating junk food and eating and playing simultaneously. Gaming addiction also disturbs sleep patterns. Thus, gaming addiction is a serious problem and puts various aspects of lives of people at risk. Addiction is a chronic condition where the mind perceives the gameplay as pleasurable and stress reducing but it has adverse effects on the young people and their families. Video games improve a person's self-confidence and self-esteem. The person becomes empowered and thinks that they can handle the complex challenges of life. It also improves the decision making speed of the people. But it becomes quite dangerous as it is often the violence based action games that improves the decision making abilities. While playing games teamwork is involved and it improves teamwork and cooperation skills. Contributing to the team and getting rewarded for it also makes the young people feel empowered and energetic. Games that involve puzzle solving and mathematical skills engage people who have interests in mathematics and solving puzzles. This results in more number of hours being spent on playing games. If this continues for longer periods, it becomes addictive. Gaming gives a real workout to the player's brain. As the players continue to play games, the level of difficulty increases and people find the game more engaging. They find it challenging and have an urge to solve the more difficult levels. As it involves multi-tasking, it gives a sense of high self-esteem and the players feel improvements in their motor skills, decision-making abilities and cognitive skills. Often friends in the peer groups recommend games to their friends. Social conversations and social buzz created about online gaming attracts younger people toward it. Engaging advertisements and fascinating graphics also contribute to increase in online gaming. Thus, all these factors together contribute to more engagements, less number of working hours and more hours in playing games.",      
    "Topic19": "The present decade of 21st century is changing the entertainment industry at a rapid pace. The entertainment industry has witnessed higher growth due to the emergence of over the top technological platforms or video streaming platforms in India. At the start of the decade, almost 60% of the film revenue came from theatrical screening of movies and remaining share of revenue was generated by other sources such as CD/DVD release, DTH rights and other overseas rights. But now this trend is changing fast as the demand for video streaming platforms is increasing rapidly. Technology such as low cost internet, cheaper mobile devices, wifi sticks, on the go video streaming etc. have enabled the rise of the OTT (Over-the-Top) platforms. These platforms are reducing the dependence on theatres, CDs and DVDs for new content. They stream conventional TV channels as well as web series that are exclusively available on these platforms. As per the recent study, the most preferred content on these platforms is web series. Over 34% of viewers watch web series on these platforms. About 16% users watch movies and news on these platforms, 13% viewers watch reality TV shows whereas 10% users watch live sports events. Mostly Hindi content (over 80%) is viewed on these platforms. These platforms are famous among viewers due to various reasons. Primarily, it is used for entertainment purposes Leisure time is spent by people watching their favourite web series, news, sports etc. on these platforms. It provides high mobility People can watch the shows while travelling, during lunch hours, during rest periods and it can be accessed anywhere and anytime. These platforms provide their services on mobile devices which are convenient to use. The cheap costs of data have also enabled the users to watch the web series and other contents online on their mobile devices at their own convenience. The applications providing these contents on the phones are very easy to use. They do not require installation of any set top box; dish set up or evens a television. All it requires is a smartphone and a good internet connection. Moreover, the content on these platforms is provided on demand. A person can open the OTT application and start watching whatever show they want to see. They don't need to wait for any scheduled timings in the day when the particular show will be available to them. These platforms are also cost effective. They are free to download and the monthly subscription fee is very low as compared to the traditional set top box or movie theatres. The content on these platforms can be personalised and any language of one's choice can be choose to watch the available content. They are also characterised by regular updates. Unlike the set top boxes and movie theatres where new shows and movies are available after longer periods of time, shows on the online platforms are available with regular updates. A diverse range of genres are available on demand. People can watch horror, comedy, drama, classic, romance, epics and various other themes, all on one platform with a single subscription fee All these factors, together have contributed to the rise of these online platforms in India. These applications have further potential of changing the entertainment industry in India and taking its growth to new levels. Conventional satellite channels provide the broadcasters with the discretion to a particular content. The government authorities are incharge of determining whether a particular content is suitable for being shown to the public. Emergence of online streaming has reduced the role of government in regulation. There are rules and regulations to regulate television operators but they fail to put any checks and balances on the newly emerging online streaming platforms. The personalised subscription based content on these platforms also reduces the surveillance that can be put up in these platforms. These OTT platforms, streaming various web series are self-regulated. They have signed their self-made censorship code that prohibits them from showing certain types of contents and set up a grievance redressal mechanism for consumer complains. However, not all platforms have signed this code. Hence, many of these web series are still unregulated and their content is still not scrutinised before being aired. Though the government has said that they will regulate online content but rules are not yet clear. The regulation is carried out by Cinematograph Act of 1952 and Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1955 and Cable TV Network Rules, 1994. These rules and laws lays down program and advertising codes that need to be followed during these broadcasts, but the definitions under these laws do not cover web series content on the OTT platforms. Thus, these platforms and web series are free to broadcast content that is on demand, whether it is abusive, obscene or hurt feelings and sentiments of a particular community. Thus, the unregulated nature of the OTT web series should be regulated by a separate body and laws, so that the regulatory loopholes can be filled. The web series and associated content over the digital platforms have succeeded in reaching the wider audiences. But explicit content and violent content is also reaching our children’s and has adverse effects on their mindsets and lives. The advantages of censoring and regulating online web series content includes It protects the freedom of speech and expression of people as watching a particular web series is also included in expression and speech. Censorship and regulation can keep the people, particularly the children, away from violent and sexually manipulating content that can expose them to pornographic materials and various forms of discrimination. Thus, freedom of one community is balanced with that of the other community. Censoring and regulating this type of content can also prevent the people from being victims of abuse, violence and becoming perpetrators themselves. Children can get influenced and it could lead to changes in their behaviours that are harmful for others. It prevents certain religious and social groups from watching offensive content in these web series. Web series often broadcasts that type of content which is eye catching and involves controversies. This is broadcasted to get as much subscribers and views as one can. Thus, regulating this type of content, which is religiously and socially offensive, can be done to maintain a balance in the society. It will also prevent violent crimes and abusive culture that is taking roots in the Indian society. Many of the web series thrive upon violent and uncensored crime scenes that particularly influence the young people and they get indulged in these types of activities at an early age. The adolescent population is particularly vulnerable to such content. Certification and censorship will also improve the content being broadcasted on these online platforms in the form of web series. More relevant content that is relevant for Indian society can be made as opposed to the current western influence on these platforms. Regulation will also curtail the unfair advantages that are enjoyed by the OTT platforms broadcasting web series as compared to the traditional television. Thus, it will provide fairness and healthy competition on these platforms.",      
    "Topic20": "Childhood is considered to be the golden period of one's life but this doesn't hold true for some children who struggle to make their both ends meet during their childhood years. At a tender age, which is supposed to be an age of playing and going to school, some children are compelled to work in factories, industries, offices or as domestic help. Child labour means employment of children in any kind of work that hampers their physical and mental development, deprives them of their basic educational and recreational requirements. According to the data from Census 2011, the number of child labourers in India is 101 million of which 5.6 million are boys and 4.5 million are girls. Earlier, the children used to help their parents in agricultural practices such as sowing, harvesting, reaping and taking care of cattle etc. But industrialisation and urbanisation have in a way encouraged child labour. Now, children are employed in hazardous work such as bidi rolling, cracker industry, pencil, matchbox and bangle making industries, roadside dhabas (restaurants), hotels etc. Working in these industries possess great risk to child physically and mentally. Some of them are: In the bidi industry, children are expected to perform all the chores of rolling, binding and closing the ends of bidis using their nimble fingers. The cracker industry poses threat to the lives of the children due to their direct exposure to the explosive material. The bangle and pencil making industries make the child susceptible to different respiratory problems and lung cancer, in the worst cases, Besides, children are employed as labourers in the garment, leather, jewellery and sericulture industry where children's health suffers due to poor working conditions. A number of factors could be attributed to the rise of this menace. In the poor lower strata families, children are considered to be an extra earning hand. These families have a conviction that every child is an earner, so they have more number of children. The children are expected to shoulder their parents' responsibilities Parental illiteracy is also one of the contributors to this problem. Education tends take a backseat in the lives of these children. The uneducated parents consider education as an investment in comparison to the returns which they get in the form of earnings of their children. Employers also prefer child labourers in comparison to adults. This is because they can extract more work and still afford to pay the children lesser amount. The child labourers are subjected to unhygienic conditions, late working hours and different atrocities which have a direct effect on their cognitive development. Due to poor working conditions and undernourishment, child suffers from various health complications. The young and immature minds of the children find it difficult to cope with such situations leading to different emotional and physical problems. Uneducated/Unguided children who work in society sometimes get influenced by criminal activities and commit crimes at a low age. Bonded child labour is one of the worst forms of child labour. In this, the children are made to work in order to pay off a loan or debt of the family. Bonded labour has resulted into trafficking of the children from rural to urban areas in order to work as domestic helps or in small production houses or just lead the life of street beggars. The government has an important role to play in this fight against child labour. As poverty is one of the major cause of child labour in India, the government needs to assure that it provides basic amenities to all its citizens and there is an equal distribution of wealth. It needs to generate sufficient jobs to assure employability to the poor. At the same time, NGOs can provide vocational training to people in order to g them good jobs or to make them self-employed. The government, in collaboration with NGOs, should reach out to the poor people to make them understand the importance of education. They should be made aware of the government's initiate to provide free education to all the children between the age group of 6-14 year the parents must be encouraged to send their children to the schools instead of work places. To prohibit the child labour in India, the Nobel Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi took an initiative. He is the founder of Bachpan Bachao Aandolan (BBA), an organisation dedicated towards the eradication of child labour and rehabilitation the rescued former child workers. The former President Pranab Mukherjee launched a ‘100 million for 100 million’ campaign, that was conceptualised to end child labour, child slavery, violence against children, etc. Educated citizens can contribute significantly in spreading the about the harmful effects of child labour High income group families can peel in funds to support the education of poor children Schools and colleges can come up with native teaching programmes for the pure children. The principle of ‘Each one, teach’ one can be followed Children of the support staff (pes, clerks etc.) of schools and colleges can be offered free education. There are certain things we can do at our level to combat the menace of child labour. The need of the hour is to expand the machinery for enforcing the various lows on child labour. If child labour is to be eradicated from India, the government and those responsible for the enforcement need to do their job sincerely. The Indian Government enacted many laws to protect child rights, namely the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1956, the factories Act, 1948, the Mines Act, 1952, the Bonded Labour System Abolition Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. Most of these acts prohibit the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, hazardous occupations or in bondage. The National Policy on Child Labour, 1987 looks into the rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations. Article 39 of the Indian Constitution declares the duty of the state to provide the children the facilities to develop in a healthy and congenial environment and in conditions of freedom and dignity. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 mandates free and compulsory education to all children between the age group of 6to 14 years Apart from this, it also reserves 25 per cent seats in every private school for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society. In May 2015, the government approved a proposal allowing children below 14 years of age to work in family enterprises or entertainment industry with specific conditions. In July 2016, the Parliament passed the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2016. This Act amends the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 by widening its scope against child labour and provides for stricter punishment for violations. This Act completely banned employment of children under 14 years in certain occupations like bidi-making, mines, powerlooms, domestic work etc. and also provides for the rehabilitation of children. Key international laws dealing with child labour include the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 1989 and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment of 1973 and on the Worst Forms of Child Labour Conventions, 1999 Indians Government has ratified both the ILO Conventions which deal with the minimum age for admission to employment and with prohibition of the worst forms of child labour.",      
    "Topic21": "Sanitation strategy is the process of providing facilities, services and provisions for the safe disposal of human waste According to World Health Organisation (WHO), about 60% of world's open defection takes place in India. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of diseases world-wide. The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India, launched the Ten year Rural Sanitation Strategy (2019-29) in September, 2019. It focuses on sustaining the sanitation and behaviour change that has been achieved under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Grameen (SBM-G), ensuring that no one is left behind and increasing access to solid and liquid waste management. For this, Government divided all the areas into three categories (ODF) An area can be declared as Open Defecation Free (ODF), if not even single person is found defecating in the open at any point of the day. (ODF+) If the area is declared as ODF and all community and public toilets are functional and well maintained at any point of the day ODE++ If the area is already declared as (ODF++) and the faecal sludge/septage and sewage are safely managed and treated with no discharging or dumping of untreated faecal sludge into the open drains, water bodies or areas. Several sanitation programmes had been in operation in the country from 1986 onwards, but their achievements were slow and unsatisfactory. Throughout the Indian history from Patanjali's philosophy to the writings of Vivekananda and the Gandhian concept of sanitation, the emphasis on sanitation has always been integral to India's cultural foundation. Though built on a history of understanding the relevance of sanitation, marginal concern was accorded to it among human settlements developed in the pre-independence period under British rule. Then, in 1986, the Government of India launched the Central Rural Sanitation Programme (CRSP), the first nationwide sanitation programme. Several other nationwide Sanitation Programmes have been launched since then such as the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) 1999 in rural India and Basic Service for Urban Poor (SUP), 2005 and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renew Mission (NNURM) in urban India.  After the launch of SBMG in 2014, over 10 crore toilets have been built in ro areas and over 39 lakh villages, 699 districts and 35 States/LITy has declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODP) The Ten year Rural Sanitation Strategy lays work to guide gram panchayats, policy makers, implementers and other stakeholders in their planning for ODF Plus status in which everyone is a toilet and every village has access to solid and liquid waste management Before 2014, less than 50% households in the country had access to sanitation facilities (even lesser in rural areas), only 50% of the generated wastewater and sewage treated before being discharged into rivers and streams and about four lakhs children each year died of diseases such as cholera, dysentery and diarrhoea or suffered from stunted growth as a result of poor sanitation. The current ODF plus Strategy is different from the earlier programmes, as it he given a major role to the Gram Panchayats in waste management. Further, it in aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to clean water and sanitation, which were both missing in earlier programmes Two salient features the rural sanitation strategy are to sustain the gains made under SBM-G and to achieve a clean living environment with solid and liquid waste management. The first element of the ODF Plus Strategy is sustained usage of individual household latrines on a continual basis. One problem with age of rural household latrines has been non-availability of piped water or continual source of water to ensure cleanliness of household latrines. This is related to the Jal Jeevan Mission of the Ministry of Jal Shakti, under which piped water supply to all n households will be ensured by 2024. Other elements of the ODF Plus Strategy include ensuring that no one is left behind from earlier Sanitation Programmes, providing sanitation access to new households, sanitation coverage of public spaces through public and community toilets, implementation of solid and liquid waste management in rural areas and maintenance of visible cleanliness. Gram Panchayats will be the key in realising ODF Plus with support from Village Water and Sanitation Committees. It will be responsible for ensuring ODF sustainability, adoption of solid and liquid waste management and continuation of sanitation behaviour as well as monitoring for slippages.  The Gram Panchayats will conduct rapid assessment of water and sanitation gaps and develop plans with the involvement of the community to address the gaps. They will create management systems for the operation and management of sanitation services and sensitise communities for contributing funds towards the required infrastructure. Waste management through ODF Plus Strategy will take place in the areas of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste management, greywater management and Fecal Sludge Management (FSM). Non-biodegradable household waste management will focus on plastic waste, as it is a major problem today. Greywater is the waste water generated from water used in the kitchen, for bathing and washing clothes. It stagnates, leading to breeding to the mosquitoes and incidence of diseases. It may reach ponds, lakes and rivers, causing both microbial and chemical pollution. Sludge Management will include construction of FSM treatment plants for village clusters or using existing Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) facilities of nearby urban areas. While the sanitation infrastructure is being upgraded, the village population will need to change their information, education and communication strategy. It means giving messages through the mass media such as radio, TV, newspapers, etc. at Central and State levels for reinforcing behaviour change and continued inter-personal communication at the household level to sustain the usage of toilets and for use of overall safe sanitation practices. Further, the capacity of the rural communities will be strengthened through at number of measures The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) will help to enhance skills in sanitation and allied sectors. Each state and district will have a Training Management Unit (TMU) to provide oversight and support to the capacity strengthening interventions. The district level TMII shall have the responsibility of imparting training at the Block level for all the Gram Panchayat functionaries. Sustaining the gains from SBM-G and moving towards ODF Plus, require high managerial and operational competence to ensure sustainability and utilisation of investments in sanitation. In addition, government funding will remain the primary source of financing in the sanitation sector. However, encouraging alternate means of financing is an important focus area to ensure sustainable financing of sanitation in rural India Monitoring and evaluation on a regular basis of the success of all these measures is necessary. Thus, sample surveys will be conducted by an independent verification agency to assess issues related to continued usage of toilets, sustainability of ODF villages and progress on solid and liquid waste management.",      
    "Topic22": "Secularism means separation of religion from political, economic, social and cultural aspects of life and religion being treated as a purely personal matter It emphasizes dissociation of the state from religion and full freedom to all religions and tolerance of all religions. It also stands for equal opportunities for followers of all religions and no discrimination on grounds of religion. Secular traditions are very deep rooted in the history of India Indian culture is based on the blending of various spiritual traditions and social movements In ancient India, the Sanatan Dharma (Hinduism) was basically allowed to develop as a holistic religion by welcoming different spiritual traditions and trying to integrate them into a common mainstream. Even after the advent of Jainism, Buddhism and later Islam and Christianity on the Indian soil, the quest for religious toleration and co-existence of different faiths continued In medieval India, the Sufi and Bhakti Movements bonded the people of various communities together with love and peace. The leading lights of these movements were Khwan Moinuddin Chisti, Baba Farid, Sant Kabir Das, Guru Nanak Dev, Saint Tukaram and Mira Bai, etc. The spirit of secularism was strengthened and enriched through the Indian Freedom Movement too, though the British have pursued the policy of divide and rule. However, Indian Freedom Movement was characterised by secular tradition and ethos right from the start Gandhiji's secularism was based on a commitment to the brotherhood of religious communities based on their respect for and pursuing of truth, whereas, JL. Nehru's secularism was based on a commitment to scientific humanism tinged with a progressive view of historical change. The term 'secularism' is like to the Vedic concept of 'Dharma Nirapekshata' ie th indifference of state to religion. The model of secularism adopted by the western societies is based on the complete separation of religion and state (ie. separation of church and the state) Indian philosophy of secularism is related to ‘Sarva Dharma Sambhava' (literally it means that destination of the paths followed by a religions is the same, though the paths themselves may be different) which mean equal respect to all religions. This concept, embraced and promoted by personalities like Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi is called Positive secularism' that reflects the dominant ethos of Indian culture. India does not have an official state religion. However, different personal laws on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, alimony varies with individual's religion. Indian secularism is not an end in itself but a means to address religious plurality and seeks to achieve peaceful co-existence of different religions. There is a clear incorporation of all the basic principles of secularium into various provisions of Constitution. The term Secular' was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976 (India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic) It emphasises the fact that constitutionally, India is a secular country which has no state religion. And that the state shall recognise and accept all religions and not favour or patronise any particular religion While, Article 14 grants equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all, Article 15 enlarges the concept of secularism to the widest possible extent by prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth Article 25 provides Freedom of Conscience', that is, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion. As per Article 26, every religious group or individual has the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and to manage its own affairs in matters of religion Article 51A i.e. Fundamental Duties obliges all the citizens to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood and to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture. While the Indian Constitution declares the state being absolutely neutral to all religion, our society is steeped in religion. Mingling of religion and politics that is mobilisation of votes on grounds of primordial identities like religion, caste and ethnicity, have put Indian secularism in danger. Communal politics operates through communalisation of social space, by spreading myths and stereotypes against minorities, through attack on rational values and by practicing a divisive ideological propaganda and politics. Politicisation of any one religious group leads to the competitive politicisation of other groups, thereby resulting in inter-religious conflict. One of the manifestations of communalism is communal riots. In recent past also, communalism has proved to be a great threat to the secular fabric of Indian polity. Rise of Hindu Nationalism in recent years have resulted into mob lynching on mere suspicion of slaughtering cows and consuming beef. In addition with this, forced closure of slaughterhouses, campaigns against love jihad, reconversion or ghar-wapsi (Muslims being forced to convert to Hinduism), etc., reinforces communal tendencies in society, Islamic fundamentalism or revivalism pushes for establishing Islamic state based on Sharia Law which directly comes into conflict with conceptions of the secular and democratic state. In recent years, there have been stray incidences of Muslim youth being inspired and radicalised by groups like ISIS which is very unfortunate for both India and the world.",      
    "Topic23": "A social networking site is an online platform which people use to build society. A network or social relationship with other people who share similar persons or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections. Social media has facilitated a lot in reshaping communication industry and redefining the ways in which we communicate and express ourselves. Social media engages people constantly and accumulate everyone in some or the other trending activity. People have embraced social media so persistently that it has become an integral part of our lives now. It is being used not only by individuals but also businesse, organisations and governments, who are utilising social media platforms for constant engagement with the masses. However, there are a number of evidences from different studies that shows that increase in the usage of smartphone and social media leads to mental distress, self-injurious behaviour and suicidal tendency among youth. The list of social media platforms is growing and these platforms are always evolving. On these platforms, users can share thoughts, curate content, upload photos and videos; form groups based on interests and participate in lively discussions. They're built around the user and everything that's important to these and their social circles. Following are the types of social media networks - Most of us are familiar with social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. These platforms help us connect with friends, family and brands. They encourage knowledge sharing and are all about personal, human to human interaction. Social media platforms like Instagram, Youtube and Snapchat are used to share photographs, video and other kinds of media on the web. Discussion Forums Social media channels like Reddit, Quora and Digg are used for finding, sharing and discussing different kinds of information, opinions and news. Social media networks like Pinterest, Flipboard helps to find out, share, discuss and save a variety of latest content and media that are trending as well. Customer Review Networks Sites like Yelp, Zomato, TripAdvisor helps you to find, share and review different information about a variety of products, services or brands. In India, millions of people use social networking sites for is home to over 400 million people that use social media platforms. The number of social media users has increased by 130 million between 2019 and 2020. Most of the users in India are using social media platforms through their mobile devices, which are prone to hacking and malicious activities. Every social media has two sides-bright and dark. It can either be a help or a hindrance depending on the way how people use it. It is a known fact that social media sites have been used for various purposes that have brought a revolution in the society. On the other hand, there have also been various negative consequences of use of social media. Thus, it has the following advantages as well as disadvantages. Some of the advantages of social media are as follows Connecting People. The primary advantage of social media is connectivity. People from all over the world can connect with each other easily. Social media connects us with people we may never meet in person, yet we're still able to develop a strong relationship with these people. Equivocal Expression On social media platform, there are no regulators when someone publishes something via his/her social profile. A person can express his/her opinion without any outside influence. Social media has emerged as a democratised platform. Small businesses and large businesses now have the same opportunities to speak with people through social media platforms. They can advertise their products through social media platforms. Another primary advantage of social media is that there are sections and groups on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter which are dedicated to help people out who are facing any issues regarding any product or services. Brands are also now able to tailor their products and services to what people really need and are looking for. Social networking helps narrow the gap between a company and their current and/or potential consumers. Education Social media have immensely benefited the education sector all over the world. With the arrival of online classes to the availability of all kinds of learning resources, every student can easily educate themselves. Some of the disadvantages of social media are as follows As the reach of social media is increasing, there's both 'real' and 'fake' information to be found via social content People can find real news and they can find fake news, laid out as real. Social media can also facilitate cyber-bullying, which can take disagreements to new levels, leaving little escape for victims. People seem to feel bolder and more apt to attack others when hiding behind their screens. Social media can be addictive Social media is quite addictive and is highly damaging and detrimental for personal lives. Social media addiction result into poor performance in academics, increased inferiority complex due to constant comparison with others and deficit of real-life social skills and emotional intelligence. Many of servers of these social media Apps are located outside the country. There have been instances of data leakage and breach of the privacy of its users Many of the users of social media are adolescents who are generally unaware of privacy guidelines. The recent example of Bois Locker Room in Delhi was seen in this context. The excess use of networking sites has created many health issues. People who are addictive to these sites experience many negative side effects such as headache, eye strain, sleep deprivation etc. Social media and networking have grown tremendously in the last two decades. The growth of social media sites has mainly been aided by a large number of young people in India. India has the largest number of Facebook users in the world. It has offered a large number of opportunities to individuals, small businesses, educators, marketing companies, schools and colleges etc. Thus, the social networking media is here to stay and grow leaps and bounds Also, e-learning has become a part of daily routine. Thus, there is a prospect for the growth of more users on social networking sites. There is need to strictly regulate the flow of misinformation, abuse, fake news etc) that have the ability to harm the citizens There should be laws and policies clearly defining as to how the data of the people is to be stored, used and shared because it concerns the national security and sovereignty of India. If social media is regulated appropriately, it will bring enormous benefits for everyone.",      
    "Topic24": "Today, we are facing rapid increase in population in many parts of the world. The sudden increase in the number of individuals in a community is often termed as population explosion. In the past 200-300 years, the world's population has increased tremendously. It is predicted that the human population will increase by 1 billion in the next decade Population explosion results mainly due to accelerating birth rate, a decrease in infant mortality and increase in life expectancy. Many people look at the population explosion as a problem or have negative viewpoint about it, however, several people also look at it as a huge opportunity for a Nation to achieve its ambitions. It can be said that population growth can be blessing, but when it put the pressure on resources, it becomes bane. India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population. According to the 2011 Census Report, the population of India is 1.21 crore with 62.37 crore males and 58.64 crore females. The total literacy rate in the country at present is 74.04%. The density of population is 382 persons/sq km. UN report of The World Population Prospect 2017 revision by Department of Economics and Social Affairs has forecasted that Indian population will surpass the population of China by 2025. Population growth and demography is a multi-dimensional concept, hence many scholars from different fields such as Geography, Economics and Anthropology have suggested many reasons for the rapid growth of Indian population. In this section, we will discuss various social, economic and political causes for population growth in India. The high illiteracy and absence of rationalism among people the main reasons for high birth rate. The religiously orthodox and conservative people are against the use of family planning measures. Compared to developed countries, the age of marriage for girl child is low in India. Further, she is burdened with reproducing a son which creates a scenario of unwanted girl child. Similarly, emphasis on agriculture, dominance of joint family and high rural population are seen as other reasons for the population growth. Widespread poverty is also the cause of increase in population. Poor people believe more children as an asset. In addition to it, there is lack of social security in India, hence children are seen as insurance by many communities in India. The high infant mortality rate also pushes people to reproduce more children. Political Causes India is a democratic polity where political leaders are seen patron in chief of the community. Since representative of people are selected on majority of votes polled, their respective community's leaders discourage population control measure. Further, population control measures are seen as government sponsored program with citizens as beneficiary whereas in other developed countries, it is movement by citizens and supported by the government. Around 50% of India's population is directly or indirectly indulged in agriculture which is subsistence in nature, hence more children are seen as helping hands in highly intensive agricultural operation. The phenomenon of population explosion has led to various problems that includes low rate of capital formation because of high dependency ratio, low standard of living, high poverty and lower productivity of labour. Some of the effects of population explosion are as follows - Socially, population explosion leads to migration of people from rural areas to the urban areas causing the growth of slum areas. People in slums live in most unhygienic and insanitary condition which gives birth to number of diseases. Migration in big cities often leads to several associated problems. Overcrowding traffic congestions, frequent accidents and pollution in big cities are the direct results of over population. Population explosion is the result of high birth rate. Frequent pregnancy without leaving a gap which is hazardous to health of mother leads to high death rate among women in the reproductive age. Environmental consequences of population explosion are even more dangerous. It increases pressure on land and leads to further sub-division and fragmentation which is compensated by using synthetic fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides which in turn pollute land, water and air. Lastly, increased housing and transportational needs creates pressure on existing natural resources of the country which is limited in nature. It also significantly increases the Greenhouse gas emission in atmosphere. Population growth provides us with a more number of working population Larger population provides a greater manpower. If this manpower is utilised efficiently in different sectors, it can lead the country towards prosperity. India's population is termed as a young population as the average age of Indian population is around 25-26 years, which is considered as productive age. This kind of population can help the economy to grow. Greater population means more consumers for industries. So many industries focus on the countries having large population to sell their products. These lead to competition and eventually lead to a fall in the prices of many goods. Population explosion also provides us with people of multiple talents in the fields such as sports, music, art etc. If a country invests well on human resources and provides enough opportunities to the people, it can come up with vast pool of talented people. With the increase in working age population, the dependency rate will decrease. It will also add savings and investments in the country as more people are in employable age group. This will bring economic prosperity in the long run. The increase in population puts a pressure on the several resources. This leads to the overall shortage in land, jobs, capital, housing and health services. Rapid population explosion has led to the over exploitation of the natural resources and degradation of environment. To cater the demands of ever increasing population, building the subsequent infrastructure for providing basic necessities like health, education and water become a challenge for various government authorities. For feeding a large population, we need more production of food. Even though new techniques of agriculture have increased our productions, there is still malnutrition reported in parts of country. Poverty is one of the key issues which is directly linked with over population. When the population is large, there are employment issues. Many people have the necessary qualifications but there are not enough jobs for them. Population explosion ultimately leads to the decrease in per-capita income and standard of living of the people. While the population explosion can give us many opportunities for development, it also undermines the available resources. This results in the degradation of the quality of living. The quality of an undernourished, poverty stricken, unhealthy but big society is definitely lower than a smaller but healthy, educated, economically secured and well employed society. The population can be our strength only when. We have resources and power to feed, provide the basic facilities, health care and jobs. This will mould them into an asset. But in reality, we don't have the necessary resources to do this. Therefore, we should make conscious efforts as individuals to put a curb on further population increase It is the only way through which we can secure better future for upcoming generations Highlighting the importance of population control, Prime Minister in his Independence Day Speech of 2019, equated the ‘family planning as another form of patriotism.’ Hence, family planning needs to take as another Jan andolan' by the citizens of the country in order to visualize the dream of making India a global superpower.",      
    "Topic25": "Media refers to the communication outlets or tools that are used to store and deliver the information or data. The components of the mass media include communications industry, such as print media publishing, the news media, photography, cinema, broadcasting (radio and television) and advertising In India media constitutes the fourth pillar of democracy. Media supplies the political information that influences voter's decision. They identify problems in our society and serve as a medium for deliberation. They also serve as watchdogs that we rely on for uncovering errors and wrongdoings by those who have power Media is vital in generating a democratic culture that extends beyond the political system and becomes engrained in the public consciousness over time. Free and fair elections that are crucial for success of democracy require a free media sector which can give candidates equal access and report the relevant issues in a timely, objective manner. The most important feature of a democracy is the freedom of speech and expression. Media is the tool that strengthens the concept of speech and expression in India's democracy. It is a watchdog of democracy. Media is important because of the following reasons - It builds an informed citizenry In order to participate freely in a polity, the citizen must be duly informed and must have the right to participate freely in a society. Media acts as a vital tool to disseminate such information to the citizen so that they are able to exercise their freedom. A free media improves the government functioning and helps it form public policies that are guided by public welfare. It informs the government of public demands and needs of sections of citizens. Media lets people voice their opinion on governance and reform and helps in building public consensus to bring about change. Media helps in exposing corruption in public and private agencies that are involved in public life. Investigative journalism motivates public authorities to act against corrupt people. Media influences the ideology of people as well as nations. It allows the people to choose from various ideologies and bring about necessary ideological changes required in public policies. Media influences the ideology of people as well as nations. It allows the people to choose from various ideologies and bring about necessary ideological changes required in public policies. Media strengthens the foundations of a democracy and democratic society. It acts as a catalyst for development and democratic values. It acts as an agent for bringing transparency and accountability in the public bodies. Media also plays an important role in giving voice to the marginalised. The poor and vulnerable people, who are voiceless, are empowered when media allows them a platform to raise their concerns. World Press Freedom Index puts India at 142nd rank in its 2020 report. This is alarming, seeing the significance of a free media for the smooth functioning of democracy. If media is corrupt and biased, democracy cannot function smoothly. Media in India forms the fourth pillar of democracy and is plagued with several issues. There is lack of freedom of media houses, control by large corporates, and violence against journalists, paid and fake news etc. Media accountability has diminished and it does not provide holistic and comprehensive view of issues concerning public interest. Media has increasingly been seen favouring certain political ideologies and disrespecting others. The following are the challenges to a free media in India - Paid News The press council of India defines paid news as ‘any news or analysis appearing in any media (print & electronic) for a price in cash or kind as consideration.’ In past few decades there is sudden growth in the number of news channels. Further there is unholy nexus between media politicians and corporates which has created a scenario where news is seen by many as a form of political advertisement. Contrary to the past where media outlet was run for social cause and not for profit, today they have become another business enterprise where profits have become the sole motive. Additionally, the decline in autonomy of editors/ journalists due to emergence of contract system and poor wage levels of journalists has played a key role in rise of the incidences of paid news Innocent including voters, who rely on the truthfulness of a news article are constantly coming across such paid news in favour of a particular party or candidate. Such readers can hardly distinguish between actual news and advertisement of a particular party or candidate, published as a news article. Fake news is any misinterpretation of information, created to deliberately misinform or deceive readers. It can influence people's views, push political agenda or cause confusion and chaos among different communities Contrary to paid news which is limited to registered media houses fake news is generally attributed to social media whose usage in India has increased manifold in past few years Now India has largest number of social media users in the world across platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube etc. Fake stories and rumors spread through social media have been connected to various incidents of mob attacks and lynching in the country under pressure from the government and regulators such as the Election Commission, social media platforms have introduced various restrictions on sharing of posts and blocked accounts of many users involved in spreading misinformation. Sensationalism is a type of editorial bias in mass media in which events and topics in news, stories and pieces are over-hyped to increase viewership or readership numbers. Sensationalism may include reporting about generally insignificant matters and events that don't influence overall society, as well as biased presentations of newsworthy topics in a sensationalist, trivial or tabloid manner. Sensational news reporting in the wake of Ayodhya verdict created discord among various groups and disturbed the social harmony. Recently, India dropped to 142nd position in the World Press Freedom Index. Violence against journalists, attacks by Maoists and reprisals by criminal groups or corrupt politicians is one of the most striking characteristics of the current state of press freedom in India. A democracy cannot thrive if its media is shackled. Only a free media is capable of remaining un-biased, thus strengthening democracy. ‘Trial by Media’ is a phrase popular to describe the impact of television and newspaper coverage on the reputation of a person by creating a widespread perception of guilt regardless of any verdict in a court of law. High-publicity court cases like actor Sushant Singh Rajput case, the media are often accused of provoking an atmosphere of public hysteria which makes a fair trial, nearly impossible. As a result regardless of the result of the trial, the accused is forced to live the rest of their life with intense public scrutiny. This partisan behaviour is not in line with the media ethics. Media is necessary for democracy and development. It helps in making public participation meaningful. If media is honest and committed in its job, democracy is bound to function more efficiently and the loopholes present in any democratic system can certainly be eliminated. On the contrary, if media is biased, corrupt and favours only a particular party or few individuals, it can prove to be very dangerous for the smooth functioning of democracy. Among the steps suggested to curb the menace of paid and fake news, breaking of media-corporate nexus through crowd funding for media institutions, encouragement to fact checking website for social media and monitoring of content being spread on social media through an autonomous organization will be instrumental in strengthening the quality of media. Certainly, there is still a lot of scope for improvement by which the media can fulfil the aspirations of the people for which it is primarily meant.",      
    "Topic26": "Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO), are voluntary organisation because N they are free from governmental control in their functioning. They are democratic and open to all those wishing to become member of the organisation and serve the society. They have assumed a significant space in civil society, which is fast emerging today due to the weakening of the state We can further define NGOs as formally registered not-for profit anoxiation of groups of individuals founded on the principles of equality, altruism and voluntary work spirit to promote human development (including environment and biodiversity) and nation building NGO is a popular term, which has gained recognition at global level and commands respect in society due to its welfare services in society. The organisation does seek financial assistance from the government but it operates atleast theoretically, on its own principles and programmes NGOs are, in principle open to voluntary membership. Any one may become member by choice and resign from the organisation at one's own will. NGO's Role in Government's Five Year Plans India is a very big country. Government since Independence has lacked sufficient man power and logistics to reach each and every segment of the society The vacuum created by this absence has been taken up by NGOs Over the years they have found place in the Five Year Plans of the government. Sometimes, it is in the form of their roles in the rural sector development and sometimes it is in the formation of self-reliant groups. When Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) was launched in 6th Five Year Plan, they were at the forefront mobilising rural poor to avail benefits. Similarly, they served as crucial machinery for social audit of many schemes and programmes. In the success of White revolution, NGOs played a significant role in mobilising the rural women milk producer and urged them to form a cooperative. They also took the government message of family planning programme to the rural India by organising many awareness programmes through Nukkad Natak. The NGO Akshay Patra has been a unique partner of government in universalisation of primary education by organising mid-day meals for millions of children Similarly, Rashtriya Mazdoor Sangh of Rajasthan was at the forefront in making Right to Information a legal right for all the citizens of the country. Non-government organisations are playing imperative role in the empowerment of women. They adopt multiple strategies to improve the condition of women NGOs are training women in various aspects to make them to come out of their inhibitions and involve in fruitful activity. The past few years have seen a rampant increase in crime against women in the form of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. These horrifying incidents leave deep scars that young girls and women are unable to cope with. They lose their self-esteem and confidence. It is over here that NGOs take the charge, counsel them, help gain their lost self-esteem and make them self-reliant. In fact, there are many NGOs which are fighting a legal battle on the behalf of the survivors. NGOs have played a vital role in educating the farmers and introducing them to new techniques of farming. They make farmers aware of the new cost saving techniques, special variety of seeds and manures etc. Additionally, they also protect farmers from any price sludge in the market prices of their produce. NGOs were at forefront in successful mediation between potato grower farmers in Gujarat and PepsiCo. As the volunteers of NGOs have the ability to develop a bond with a particular cause and the concerned entities, it helps in easy implementation and execution of different governmental schemes. They have played an important role in making people understand the importance of education, curbing the menace of social evils such as child marriage, sati etc. Night schools have become common in the rural areas where the children and working adults can come and study. In the domain of health, important international bodies such as UNICEF, WHO and FAO have forged unique partnership with NGOs in India to teach and make the masses aware in inculcating various strategies to ward off many diseases. For instance, making them aware about importance of hand wash, importance of vaccination among others. Infact in last two incredible feat achieved by India, the Pulse Polio Program and Swachh Bharat Initiative have been made only through unique partnership between NGOs and government. They transitioned this government scheme into Jan Andolan through people's participation. The importance of NGOs has been mostly noted in the crisis caused by any disaster. Be it the Kerala flood or Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal, they were often the first responders. Apart from escorting the affected people to the safe places and ensuring food and other provisions, they also play crucial role in their post disaster resettlement. The way many NGOs have served an effective link for support be it financial or otherwise between prominent personalities and vulnerable section of the people in coronavirus crisis is worth appreciating. There are more than 25 lakh registered NGOs in India, many of them as reported in I report in Internal security of India' had indulged in anti-India activities. Some of them serve as appendage of their home country and were involved in halting the construction of many infrastructure and mining projects by organising protest by indigenous people. There have also been allegations of money laundering on various NGOs in India. Meanwhile Government has come up with stricter compliance norms for them in Foreign Contribution and Regulatory Act (FCRA). They have also been brought under the ambit of RTI. During last few years, several new NGOs have come up in India that claims to work for the poor. These NGOs are not often engaged in serious social welfare work many of these are without serious intent and many are fraudulent. There is disproportionately large number of NGOs. There are issues of transparency and accountability which needs reforms Allegations of corruption have also been levelled against the NGOs. Various NGOs have been purposefully indulging in undermining India's development activities. A report by the intelligence bureau has accused various international NGOs of partisanship and showing India in a bad light. NGOs have interfered with social customs and religious practices in India. PETA India fighting in the courts against the government for the Jallikattu festival is seen in this context. Several NGOs are accused of non-transparent and undemocratic functioning Many NGOs do not file their annual financial statements and only a few do so. Though FERA and FEMA have been made stricter yet issues persists. Charity and Voluntary service has been in ethos of India and NGOs as trust and not for profit companies have been nothing but its modern manifestation Government on its part recognises their importance in good governance. Faced with an unprecedented Coronavirus crisis, government has constituted the Empowered Group (EG 6) chaired by CEO, NITI Aayog to leverage the network of NGOs This EG 6 has succeeded in galvanising a network of 92,000 CSOs/NGOs to harness their strengths and resources, expertise in key social sectors such as nutrition, health, sanitation, education and extensive reach in the community Going by their importance, the NGOs need to be respected, recognised and constituted in various sectors to meet the development aspiration of the citizens of India.",      
    "Topic27": "Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. In other words, their income level is so low that basic necessities of life such as housing and food are beyond the capacity of individual and families. Each country has its own threshold of defining poverty. For some developed ones like Sweden or Norway ownership of a car or house may be the prerequisite whereas for developing and poor countries even availability of a two square meal is treated as being above the poverty line. The Human Development Report of 2019 appreciated India's effort towards bringing 270 million of its population out of poverty from the year 2003 to 2015 However, this significant feat is now facing a grave challenge amid the pandemic caused by Coronavirus Millions in India are now unemployed and have migrated back to villages from metropolitan cities. The economy is on downturn and many industries which employ huge labours are facing existential challenge. In this regard let's first understand the number of poor in India and how it is calculated. In India, NITI Aayog is nodal authority for estimation of poverty. It's precursor, the Planning commission had appointed many committees to decide the benchmark of poverty in India ie the Poverty line. These committees include National Planning Committee (1938), YK Alagh Committee (1979), Suresh Tendulkar Committee (2005) and Rangarajan Committee (2011). The NITI Aayog has t accepted Tendulkar methodology for estimation of poverty line in India. This committee recommended to shift away from the calorie-based model and made the poverty line somewhat broad based by considering monthly spending on education, health, electricity and transport also. India has the world's largest number of poor people living in it. Out of its total population of more than 1 billion, 350 to 400 million people are living below the Poverty line. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Report of Oxford, Poverty and Human Development Program of UN estimated that there were 364 crore poor individuals in India in 2015-16. According to the World Bank estimate, 21.3% of India's population falls below the International Poverty line of USD 1.90 a day. In the next section we will learn why our country is still poor despite harboring good amount of human as well as natural resources. There are a number of causes of poverty in India which are as follows - Fast growing population has reduced the per capita income of India. Hence, the standard of living has also fallen considerably. If the country is overpopulated a large part of the income is spent on consumption and very little is saved for development activities. Unemployment is one of the important reasons for poverty in India. Many people do not have job to sustain themselves and their families. 60% of population depends on agriculture in India. But the condition of agriculture sector is bad. Farmers are poor and uneducated. They have no good facilities of irrigation. They do not get seeds and fertilisers on time, all this leads to poor yield. The widening gap between the rich and the poor is also responsible for poverty in India. The rich are growing richer while the poor are getting poorer. Inflation also leads to poverty because income earned by poor people is not sufficient to buy basic necessities of life. A rise in price of a commodity forces them to remain in poverty. Poverty also has adverse consequences on the country to a large extent. It is the leading cause of insufficient diet and inadequate nutrition. The resources of poor people are very limited and its effect can be seen in their diet. Poverty is often characterised with income disparity and unequal distribution of national wealth between the rich and the poor. Apart from this women are the worst victims of poverty as it affects greater number of women than men. The total of poor women outnumbers the total population of poor men. They are deprived of proper diet, medicines and health treatment. Poverty is one of the strong reasons for increasing child labour in India. Due to low income of parents, their children are forced to indulge in various jobs which lead to child labour. Thus, poverty passes on to families and it becomes very difficult for children of poor parents to come out of poverty. Integrated Rural Development Scheme (1980) This was umbrella scheme allied programmes like Training of Rural Youth for Self-Employment (TRYSEM), Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA), Ganga Kalyan Yojana (GKY), Million Wells Scheme (MWS) and Supply of Improved Toolkits to Rural Artisans (SITRA) This scheme holistically covered each dimensions of rural development and intended to create employment opportunities and thereby reduce poverty in India. In 1999, this programme was recharacterised into Swarnajayanti Gram Rojgar Yojana. Assurance Scheme (1993). This scheme was launched to create an additional wage employment opportunity during the period of acute shortage of wage employment through manual work for the rural poor living below the poverty line. Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Yojana (1993) the main objective of this scheme was to create and provide sustainable self-employment opportunities to one million educated unemployed youth in the country during the 8th five year plan period. With modification of some parameters of the scheme, it now covers all economically viable activities including agriculture and allied activities but excluding direct agricultural operations like raising crop, purchase of manure etc. National Social Assistance Programme (1995). This programme focuses on old age person, poor families and widows and provide cash assistance to improve their standard of living. Amid the COVID induced pandemic, the government gave three months of pension in advance to over 3 crore beneficiaries of this programme. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (2005) this act is cornerstone among all poverty alleviation measures adopted by government of India. It enhances livelihood security by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana (2016) under the scheme, five crore LPG connections are to be provided to the women of BPL households. It also provides a financial support of 1600 for each LPG connection to the BPL households, interest free loan to purchase stove and refill by Oil Marketing Companies. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (2020). This scheme was launched amid the Covid induced pandemic to provide for monetary assistance and food security to millions of households, whose livelihood has been hampered by subsequent job loss and migration. Under this scheme, government will provide ex-gratia sum of 500 to 20.80 crore women Jan Dhan account holder in addition to it. 80 crore poor people will get 5 kg wheat or rice and 1 kg of preferred pulses for free every month till November. Apart from these government initiatives, several steps can be taken to reduce or eradicate poverty in India. The government has promised cheap credit to farmers, direct transfer of money to the poor and eased access to food security programmes through Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan in May 2020. However these measures will help people who have some documentation or are registered. With millions of impoverished Indians now in transit across the country, the food security situation is dire. India's economy was already growing at its slowest pace due to pandemic, the subsequent lockdowns has stalled business activities to a large extent. So, 2020 is going to be an extremely challenging year not only for governments and businesses but also for those on the border line of poverty. Government should develop cottage, handicrafts and other small scale industries in the backward regions of the country. Moreover, this will transfer resources from the areas of surplus to the deficit areas solving the problem of urbanisation. Therefore, one has to keep a thing in the mind that poverty is a menace and need to be checked. The above steps would be helpful to reduce poverty in India It is a national problem and hence must be solved on a war footing. Eradication of poverty would ensure a sustainable and inclusive growth of economy and society.",      
    "Topic28": "The status of women depicts the social, economic and mental condition in a nation. Women have been regarded as a symbol of spirituality in our scriptures. Nearly one-sixth of the world's women live in India. However, at present, challenges faced by Indian women is the result of the patriarchy, which is prevalent in Indian society. Women in India are discriminated against in various fields, such as health, education and jobs which can be regarded as socio-cultural discrimination. The situation is scary in the sense that more than the half women labour force is unpaid. They also constitute most of the informal sector, hence are vulnerable to various economic challenges and discrimination. Indian history bears the testimony to the fact that Indian woman have always been treated badly and unequally to men. Social evils such as dowry, sati-system, child marriage and female infanticide were widely prevalent in the early ages in medieval India, the social evils like sati were prevalent. Furthermore, Purdah System was much common in this period. During the British rule, acts aiming at betterment of women were enacted, including Bengal Sati Regulation Act, 1829, Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870 and Age of Consent Act, 1891. In post-independent India, various rights were granted to the women under the Constitution of India. It mainly includes equality, dignity, and freedom from discrimination. Additionally, India has various statutes governing the rights of women. As of 2019, some women have served in various senior official positions in the Indian government, including that of the President of India, the Prime Minister of India and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. However, many women in India continue to face significant difficulties. The rates of malnutrition are exceptionally high among adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women in India, with repercussions for children's health Violence again women, especially sexual violence, has been on the rise in India Challenges for Women Prevalent in India. In India, women continue to suffer discrimination, harassment, humiliation and exploitation inside as well as outside home. Theoretically, women might have been given more freedom but in practice, they still suffer many hardships, inhuman dignities and unworthy treatment everywhere. Some of the challenges which are being faced by women in India are as follows - Maternal care in India is negligible. Lack of resource and infrastructure very often results in denial of the timely care to pregnant women. In addition, lack of information sharing pertaining to do's and don'ts during pregnancy often lead to mortality of mother and infant. This phenomenon is widely observed among weaker sections of society. Girl child while growing up, is subject to various complications. The livelihood of girl child might be at risk if she is denied timely interventions pertaining to nutrition and healthcare Malnutrition and anemia among Indian girls is one of the biggest problems in the world. The lack of nutrition among girl child is widely attributed to the prejudices prevalent in Indian society where female child is discriminated against male child. Females in India have lower literacy rate corresponding to their male counterparts. This disparity in education can be traced to the time related constraint where girl as a child is asked to get involved in domestic duties. The practice is more common in rural areas. The denial of education the girl child further leads to difficulties in active participation in the workforce during adulthood. They are also devoid of satisfactory social life. Women face the challenge of child or early age marriages mostly due to family and social compulsions. In many cases, girls are married even prior to attaining sexual maturity. It burdens them with the duties of material life before their education is complete, thus, limiting their opportunities in future and denying them a chance of getting empowered. Child brides are neither physically nor emotionally ready to become wives and mothers. They face more risks of experiencing dangerous complications during pregnancy and child birth, contracting Sexually Transmitted Disease (STDs) domestic violence and sexual abuse. The women are mostly deemed fit for women specific jobs such as teachers, nurses, receptionist, babysitter, lecturer etc., which have been stereotyped for women. Also, women in India face artificial barriers and informal boundaries, which prevent them from advancing upward in their organisation into management-level positions. This can be reflected in an increasing wage gap between men and women. Safety at workplace is major issue for women. Sexual harassment at workplace is an act or a pattern of behaviour that compromises physical, emotional or financial safety and security of a woman worker. In 2018-19, ‘Me too’ Movement in India shed light on numerous instances of sexual harassment at the workplace. However, due to the slow system, justice hasn't been delivered to these women. Lack of toilets in households especially in rural India has rendered women vulnerable to various dangers. Risk of sexual molestation, rape is quite high in case of open defecation. Further, lack of privacy is another major concern and violates the dignity of the girls and women. Lack of Political Participation of Women Inadequate participation of women in governing bodies is manifestation of prejudice against women at various levels. At present, Women representation in Lok Sabha is only 14%. Government has launched various programmes and initiatives to tackle challenges which are being faced by women. The schemes aims to promote socio-economic development and gender equality while empowering the women. Some of them are as follows - Support to Training and Employment Programme for women, 1986-87 (STEP) was launched to ensure sustainable employment and income generation for marginalised, rural and urban poor women. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) was introduced in 2016 to extend financial support to pregnant women under maternity benefit programme. Government of India launched a campaign in 2015 with an aim to generate awareness and improve efficiency of welfare services intended for girls in India. National Mission for Empowerment of Women (NMEW) was launched by the Government of India in 2010 with the aim to strengthen overall processes that promote all-round development of women. Individual Household Latrine Construction (IHHL) construction under Swachh Bharat Scheme (2014) seeks to address the issue of open defecation The Sexual Harassment of women at workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 was enacted to protect women from sexual harassment at the place of work. Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was also enacted in 2012 to deter the crime against children including female child. Reservation for women in Panchayati Raj System has already been guaranteed. A Women's Reservation Bill is also pending in the Parliament of India which proposes to reserve 33% of all seates in Lok Sabha and in all State Legislative Assemblies for women. The change in social norms and mind-sets towards girls and women can be brought about through institutional initiatives. This involves the family, the community, religious and educational institutions. The state, as the largest public institution can strengthen and ensure implementation its economic and social policies for gender equality. This will have a strong and effective impact the subjective changes in perceptions and expectations towards girls and women Change is needed at the macro and micro level with wider participation of people.",      
    "Topic29": "Corruption is the unethical act performed by a person or the group of people using power of position or authority to acquire personal benefits It is a social issue which adversely affects the economy of nation Corruption is the use of unethical methods to get some advantage by others. It has become one of the hig factors which obstruct the development of the individual and country. It is like poison which has been spread in the mind of people of the society, community and country and is one of the big reasons of inequalities in the society and community. Corruption is a very old social malady. It always existed in human society in one or the other form. It is vital to note that 'Atharva Veda warns people to reframe from corruption. Kautilya's 'Arthasastra' mentions forty modus operandi adopted by the corrupt people to misappropriate government funds. The Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji had to considerably increase the pay of his land revenue staff to prevent them from indulging in corruption. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, in his book The Discovery of India' has written about widespread corruption during British rule in India. In primitive period, the scope of public administration was minimum as a result the scope of corruption was also limited. After Independence, with the concept of welfare state coming into existence, the scope of being corrupt widened. At the juncture of Independence a statesman like C Rajagopalachari called the PWD (Public Works Department) as the first enemy of the country in terms of the corruption that prevailed in that department. Nowadays, every department has become a Public Works Department. The corruption has crept into every fabric of society in such a way that it was the theme of speeches made by the President, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of Lok Sabha during the Golden Jubilee celebrations of our Independence. Every Chief Election Commissioner since T.N. Sheshan holds the office, has advocated the dire necessity of electoral reforms to strike the corruption at grassroot level and some of the measures have already been taken by them to make elections fair. The causes of corruption are many and complex. Some of them are: Emergence of political elite who believe in interest-oriented rather than nation-oriented programmes and policies are responsible for the increasing corruption in politics. Acceptance of people towards corruption and the absence of strong public forum to oppose corruption allow it to reign over people. Vast size of population combined with illiteracy and the poor economic infrastructure lead to endemic corruption in public life. In a highly inflationary economy, low salaries of government officials compel them to resort to the road of corruption. Complex laws and procedures alienating common people to ask for any help from government. Big industrialist fund, politicians to meet the high cost of election. Bribery to politicians buys influence and bribery by politicians buys votes. The foremost reason of flourishing of corruption is the virtual change in the thinking of the people. A total disregard to the moral and ethical values and the feeling of attaining the things by any means whether wrong and right has encouraged most of the generation to adopt the means of corruption. Corruption is not only acceptance or giving of bribe. It has many other forms. Corruption can be categorised into various forms. These forms are Conventional Corruption occurs when government officials, whether higher or lower ranks illegitimately receive or accumulate an undue advantage for their own personal use not regarding public interest. Unconventional Corruption exists where a government public official acts without consideration for public interests but there is no clear monetary or other transaction between the two parties It includes misappropriation, theft, breach of trust etc. Grand and petty corruption are sub-categories of conventional corruption Petty corruption involves public administration officials taking bribes for completing works of the public that fall under their control. Grand corruption involves higher ranking government officials and politicians who are in power. They exploit opportunities presented to them by government works. Political Corruption is considered as a type of grand corruption due to its seriousness and higher officials involved. It involves politicians preferring certain companies and industries over other. Here, companies and organisations that shape and influences legislations or government policies. Corruption is also distinguished by its public or private nature. Public corruption involves public officials whereas private officials are involved in private corruption. Public corruption involves misappropriation of public funds whereas private corruption involves corruption in private sector that hurts citizens' interests. Systemic corruption exists where corruption is entrenched in a society. It exists where it is routine in dealings between the government and private businesses In contrast to this, individual corruption exists where corruption is rare and consists of a few individual acts. The basic question is 'can the corruption be eradicated? It can only be possible if people understand and start to believe the values of ethics and morality in their life. To eradicate corruption from our society the fool proof laws should be made so that there is no room for discretion of politicians and bureaucrats. The role of the politicians should be minimised. Application of the evolved policies should be left in the hands of independent commission or authority in each area of public interest. Decision of the commission or authority should be challengeable only in the courts. One of the common causes which enables corruption by public servants is to demand and obtain illegal gratification which is commonly known as speed money To remove this in the administrative procedure, Madhya Pradesh Government passed a law known as the Public Services Guarantee Act' in 2010, laying down reasonable time limits for delivery of different Government services to the people In 2011, Bihar Government also passed a similar act named as 'Right to Services Act. All other State Governments should also arrange to get similar acts so that no government servant gets the scope to extract speed money. The Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha in December, 2013 which aims to effectively deter corruption, compensate citizen grievances and protect whistle blowers. Cooperation of the people needs to be obtained for successful eradication of corruption. People should have a right to recall the elected representatives if they see them becoming indifferent to the electorate. Electoral reforms are crucial to eradicate political corruption. Several reforms like state funding of election expenses for candidates making political parties get their accounts audited regularly and filing income tax returns, denying persons with criminal records a chance to contest elections should be brought in. More and more courts should be opened for speedy and inexpensive justice so that cases don't linger in courts for years and justice is delivered on time. Many systematic efforts are being made in current times to achieve reduction of corruption like The Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 for foreign black money, Income Declaration Scheme, 2016 for unearthing domestic black money, Benami Transaction Bill etc. The Central Government has set up the following four departments as anti-corruption measures: (i) Administrative Vigilance Division (AVD) in the Department of Personnel and Training, (ii) Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), (iii) Domestic Vigilance Units in the Ministries/Departments/Public Undertakings Nationalised Banks and (iv) Central Vigilance Commission etc. The government has also appointed the first Lokpal of India, Pinaki Chandra Ghose in 2019, March. The Lokpal (anti-corruption authority) will inquire into allegations of corruption against public functionaries. It will provide a new life to anti-corruption efforts in India. The government has stressed on accountability now and India can be positive for future as making everything digital with programmes like Digital India will reduce corruption to greater levels as the middle man will have no place in the system and everything can be supervised directly by government. Yes, corruption is a big problem but it can be eradicated with systematic and right efforts.",      
    "Topic30": "We are living in what is often described as the 'urban century' as over 50% of the world's population now lives in urban areas. The world continues to urbanise and this growth is mainly led by growth of world population in low and middle income countries. Though the city life is largely perceived as comfortable and lavish yet the picture on the other side is not rosy. Many areas in the urban regions are characterised by poor quality, overcrowded houses, where there is lack of safe and readily available water supplies. Sanitation, drainage and solid waste collection is poorly developed. There is little access to affordable healthcare, emergency services and more risk of contracting deadly diseases. These are the regions where the urban poor’s reside. They are always at the risk of forced eviction by the government authorities or due to court orders. According to 2011 census, almost 137 million people were living in slum areas which made up almost 17% of the total urban population of India. It is the mega cities of India where most of the growth in urban poverty occurs. Greater Mumbai, Delhi NCR and Kolkata have almost 40% of their urban population living in slum areas which are temporary spaces of living. The specific characteristics of urban poverty is related mainly with distinct characteristics - Urban poor population becomes more vulnerable as compared to the rural poor because in urban areas, people are integrated into a more formal cash economy where they are required to pay for their food and shelter, rather than relying on their own food production. They have to pay more on transport and education services as compared to the rural poor. Employment is not regularly available or may be highly insecure Shelter is illegal and insecure. Many sections of urban poor who are not able to pay for these services become homeless. Further, they are vulnerable to various economic shocks and to macroeconomic policy adjustments in prices, wages and public expenditure. The urban poor are disproportionately affected by urban environmental problems such as inadequate water which is fit for drinking, inadequate sanitation, drainage, and solid waste management, poor quality of housing that doesn't prevent them from the phenomenon of nature such as sunlight, rainfall etc. There are densely populated shanty colonies which are overcrowded and poorly managed and these are built on marginal or degraded lands. All these factors increase the health risk of the poor and reduce their productivity. They have to pay high amounts for their healthcare, which further makes them vulnerable to poverty and homelessness. The vulnerability of urban poor is high because community and inter-household mechanisms are less likely to operate in urban areas as compared to rural areas. Urban areas are characterised by higher levels of violence, alcohol, drug abuse, exploitation, discrimination as well as there is another risk of motor vehicle accidents for the urban poor. Urban poor are less likely to gain employment in urban areas because of absence of skills as compared to rural areas. In rural areas, farming and agriculture are the most practised occupations but in urban areas, an individual can not engage in farming activities. He would need to be engaged in secondary on tertiary sector activities to gainful employment hence, they becomes more vulnerable as compared to a rural poor. Following are the reasons that are responsible for urban poverty - When people who do not have sufficient incomes migrate from rural areas to urban areas for earning a living; it leads to creation of informal settlements in the cities. Most of these people do not have adequate income or skills and thus they get involved in manual work. This type of work does not provide much income to live a decent life in such a big city. These people are forced to live in slums and shanties that are temporary shelters. These conditions give rise to urban poverty. Urban areas are highly competitive places with job opportunities for people. But high influx of people from rural areas leads to lack of job opportunities. The people from rural areas coming to urban cities for jobs and employment are not very skilled and lack any professional or vocational training. They are left with only an option to search for jobs in the informal sectors such as construction work, domestic workers, rikshaw pullers. This pushes them towards more informalisation and their poverty conditions are further worsened. Commodification of even the basic services such as fool shelter, water, sanitation, health etc. has led to rising prices of these commodities. The urban poor are required to pay for the services. When they are not able to pay for such services they become unaffordable to them. The land prices are increasing in urban areas and these poor people are not able to afford the high rent. Unless the urban poor people make money with employment and job opportunities, they are not able to afford an urban life. Higher population leads to scarcity of resources. If there are more members in a family, it becomes difficult for a family to meet all their requirements Limited income and employment opportunities will not be sufficient for the urban poor to fulfil their basic needs. The poor also lack access to contraceptive and birth control services. They have no families’ access to health services which further pushes them towards the vicious cycle of poverty. Education plays an important role in survival. A well educated person is more likely to be better paid and have a secure job but the migrants coming from rural to urban areas are mostly uneducated. Lack of education for these people deprives them of various economic opportunities. Uneducated women are more vulnerable to the social ills of the society. They also face discrimination and harassment at the hands of the society. Cheap and affordable housing is not provided to the poor people migrating from the rural to urban areas. These people are deprived of housing facilities along with basic services such as electricity, water, sanitation etc. This makes them vulnerable to diseases and affects their health. They are forced to live on pavements or in undocumented community lands which are in very poor conditions. The following measures can be taken to fight urban poverty in India - In order to control large scale migration from rural to urban areas, the current state of rural infrastructure should be addressed. Small and medium scale industries can be promoted by incentivising rural people as well as other income generating opportunities should be started. These opportunities should be in the high income generating sectors that should satisfy the demands of the economy. More research can be carried out in the agricultural sector so that it can absorb more number of people and generate higher income. As the level of urbanisation will increase, informal slum development is going to take place at a faster rate Slums are nothing but the result of lack of planning and proper cheap and affordable housing to large number of migrants that come to urban areas. If there is proper planning in urban areas, then these slums can be effectively rehabilitated and instead of shanty and temporary settlements, safe and decent homes for the poor can be provided. Poor people should be able to participate in policy making that concerns their lives. The city governance should integrate the needs of the poor such as anti-poverty measures, health, education, increased allocation of resources etc. Participation of informal labour, slum dwellers, homeless people, women, elderly etc. should also get due representation in city governance. The mega cities where there is more proportion of urban poor, urban poverty departments should also set up so that specific needs of the urban poor people can be met. They should be provided with basic services such as food, education, health services, sanitation, work on daily wages etc. so that they are able to live a healthy and decent life. Adequate housing facilities should be developed by the respective State Governments so that the poor people are not deprived of their right to shelter. These housing facilities must be available to the poor for very costs and rents. There should also be provision for low cost basic facilities such as electricity, water supply, etc. Urban poverty alleviation programmes on lines of MGNREGA of rural areas can be started. These types of programmes will tackle vulnerability of the poor people and improve the economy of urban areas. These programs can be used to build new urban infrastructures and improve the existing ones. They will surely provide a sense of security in terms of livelihood for the poor and improve their standards of living. Improvements in the standard of living of one generation results in improving future generation's lives and opportunities. The trends in urban poverty suggest that the numbers of urban poor are likely to increase in the future in absence of a well-planned long term strategy. There must be effective participation of all the stakeholders such as the Central Government, State Governments, NGOs, rural as well as urban planning bodies, the vulnerable communities, job seekers as well as job providers and above all the policy makers and those who are responsible for implementing them on the grounds. The urban poverty challenge can be tackled and homelessness can be reduced by improving the lives of the people.",      
    "Topic31": "Human trafficking is one of the most heinous forms of organised crime and violation of human rights all over the world there is a strong concern on the rising trend and multidimensional nature of this criminal phenomenon which victimises men, women and children. Traffickers take into account neither borders, laws nor national prejudices. The objective of human trafficking is profit whether through abduction or deception, they trap innocent people whose lives are then transformed into the worst of nightmares Trafficking assaults human dignity. Violates Fundamental Rights and erodes conscience. It is important to understand the various types of human trafficking prevailing in the world. People can be trafficked and exploited in many forms, including being forced into sexual exploitation, labour, begging, crime, domestic servitude, marriage or organ removal Trafficking in children is likely for the purpose of either child pornography or bonded labour. Trafficking in women for sexual exploitation affects every region in the world. Victims are often provided with false promises of decent employment and are transported to the other country to be forced into sexual slavery. A forced marriage qualifies as a form of human trafficking if a woman is sent abroad, forced into the marriage and then repeatedly compelled to engage in sexual conduct. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of using their organs particularly kidneys, is a rapidly growing field of criminal activity. A Global Report on Trafficking in Persons' by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) offers the first global assessment of the scope of human trafficking. It is based on data gathered from 155 countries. According to the report, the most common form of human trafficking is sexual exploitation (79%). The victims of sexual exploitation are predominantly women and girls. The second most common form of human trafficking is forced labour (18%), although this may be a misrepresentation because forced labour is less frequent detected and reported than trafficking for sexual exploitation. Worldwide almost 20% of all trafficking victims are children. However, in some parts of Mekong region and Africa, children are the majority (100%) Bangladesh takes the first spot on the list of 155 countries with the highest rate of human trafficking in the world. Ghana in Africa has become a point of destination for a lot of trafficking in children who are forced to work labourers in the mines, specially gold mines In Uganda, children are either trafficked for forced labour or they are killed for their organs Nepal is co to be the busiest route in human trafficking where trafficking of women send Some other countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Haiti where forced labour prostitution is on high rate. Women in Iraq are also vulnerable to crimes and human trafficking while women from India (mostly from poor families) are generally sold to Saudi Arabia for marriage purpose. The consequences of human trafficking are most directly felt by those who are victims. Trafficking usually involves prolonged and repeated trauma. The victims are at great risk of HIV infection. On the other hand, there are economic consequences of human trafficking. The amount of money that countries spend in its prevention, the treatment and support of victims and the prosecution and apprehension of offenders is huge. According to estimates from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), every year the human trafficking industry generates 32 billion USD a large but non-taxable income. Initiatives have been taken worldwide to deal with the severe issue of human trafficking These include (i) UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) assisted many NGOs in their fight against human trafficking. (ii) The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UNGIHT) was conceived to promote the global fight against this crime, (iii) United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, 2010, provide humanitarian, legal and financial aid to victims of human trafficking. Human Trafficking has expanded to almost every state in India Especially in the state of Jharkhand, human trafficking is wide-spread. Some Southern states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka also lead in human trafficking. Delhi is the hotspot for illegal trade of young girls for domestic labour, forced marriage to Children especially young girls and women mostly from North-East are taken from their homes and sold in faraway states of India for sexual exploitation and to work as bonded labour. Girls are forced to marry more than one man in some states where female to male sex ratio is highly imbalanced. New data released by Indian Government shows that reports of human trafficking rose by 20% in 2016 against the previous year. National Crime Records Bureau (NCR) said that there were 8,132 human trafficking cases in against 6,877 in 2015, with highest number of cases reported in the state of West Bengal followed by Rajasthan. Efforts have been made by the Government of India to combat the issue of human trafficking. It penalises trafficking for commercial, sexual exploitation through the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act (ITPA), 1986 which prescribes penalty ranging from seven years to life imprisonment. India also prohibits bonded and forced labour through the Bonded Labour Abolition Act, the Child Labour Prohibition Act and the Juvenile Justice Act. Indian authorities also use Sections 366(A) and 372 of the Indian Penal Code prohibiting kidnapping and selling minors into prostitution respectively. As anti-trafficking nodal cell has been set-up under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Home Ministry has also launched a web portal on anti-human trafficking and the Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing ‘ujjawala’, a programme that focuses on rescue, rehabilitation and repatriation of victims. Indian Constitution bans the human trafficking in person Article 23, in the Fundamental Rights Section of the Constitution, prohibits ‘Traffic in human beings and other similar forms of forced labour’.  The government has launched a ‘Lost and Found’ or ‘Khoya Paya’ website to help families trace the tens of thousands of children in the country who go missing every year-often abducted for forced labour or sexual exploitation-and are never found. Even though a large number of efforts are being made in India as well as in the world against this crime, it is still prevailing in the society to a large extent. More efforts are needed to drive away this evil from the society at large. Some stringent t-trafficking laws and their right implementation is required. People should be educated on human trafficking issues and help the survivors to find security and happiness.",      
    "Topic32": "Capital punishment is the execution of a person by the state as punishment for crime over the ages capital punishment has been given to criminals by using various methods such as lethal injection, hanging, electrocution, gas chamber etc. The question at hand is ‘Is capital punishment justified?’ Death sentence as a punishment has been subject to controversies since long. The basic reason is the moral and humanitarian questions attached to it. For this, one needs to understand the death sentence by itself. Capital punishment or death sentence being one of the harshest punishments known to man has taken a gradual humanised change over the years. Being a mode of punishment prominently followed in most parts of the world for centuries has now been abolished in many countries. India is one of only 58 countries that have the death penalty on their statue book. India seems to be stuck between the global trend to end death penalty and the few nations that still follow it. It has taken a very safe ground by giving a minimal provision and leaving it to the discretion of the judiciary to award the punishment in special circumstances. The question that is constantly debated upon is that when should capital punishment be awarded or should it be awarded in the first place? What sort of crime or offence would demand a capital punishment? Should a serial killer with no conscience be incriminated? Some say that life-imprisonment is an easy way out and it would also give chance to reform the criminal. Most of the people now feel that punishment for crimes like murders should not be death but some reformative or deterrent sentence. Death sentence cannot reform a criminal. There is a huge uproar everywhere capital punishment and death sentence, saying it is immoral and that it infringes the inalienable right of life of an individual. Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the UN In 1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is a pledge among nations to promote Fundamental Rights as the of freedom, justice and peace in the world. Article 5 of the Declaration states that no one shall be subjected to cruel and degrading punishment. Therefore, abolitionists insist that capital punishment des be ruled out because it is cruel, inhuman and degrading The governments which have abolished death sentence, find that there is no increase in the number of murders in the countries after the abolition There are numerous arguments put forward against death sentence. The classic one is that society cannot show that killing is wrong by killing. Even Gandhiji said, ‘Hate the sin, not the sinner’. It is further added that capital punishment is a vengeance rather than retribution and as such, is a morally dubious concept. The people who want to abolish death penalty claim that it violates the sanctity of life. So isn't the sanctity of victim's life more important than the convict's life. In our real to protect the rights of criminals, we should not minimise the rights of their victims. An innocent's life should be valued over the offender's. The more common place argument given is that executing a murderer will not bring the victim back Justice is not about bringing back the dead. It is about enforcing consequences of one's own action. It is about preventing future misfortune and protecting the life of the vulnerable and about arming the weak. Some people stress on the barbaric nature of the death penalty as a reason for in abolition, forgetting that the acts committed by the people sentenced are not exactly humane. Most importantly people should understand that certainty of punishment and not severity is the real deterrent to crime. The death penalty is unjust and inhumane Miscarriage of justice is, in fact, one of the biggest concerns about the death penalty. Unfortunately, even in 21st century, someone could be wrongly hanged Studies conducted by Amnesty International have shown that the process of deciding who should be on death row is arbitrary and biased. It is a fallacy to think that one killing can be avenged with another. For, capital punishment is merely revenge masquerading as justice. Especially, in a country India where free legal aid is, at best a mockery to the system, there is no denying the fact that most of those waiting death sentence are of weaker backgrounds. The debate over capital punishment has been raging on for countless number of years. Yes, it is right that death sentence is not the solution to the increase in crimes. But, at the same time we should not ignore the fact that capital punishment has been used for thousands of years due to the fear it inflicts on the people who witness and learn about the death penalty. The use of this punishment has helped to reduce crime and alter the minds of future criminals deter them against committing heinous crimes. But, it should be given in the rare of the rarest cases after proper investigation of the criminal's offence.",      
    "Topic33": "Before seen at an impact of advertisement we must understand what advertisement means. An advertisement is a form of marketing communication, which is used to promote or sell something, usually a business product or service. Advertising is nothing, but a paid form of non-personal presentation or promotion of ideas, goods services by an identified sponsor with view to spread information concerning an idea, product or service and sell the product or increase the sale volume. The real objective of advertising is effective communication between producers and consumers. The history of advertisement dates back to 3000 BC. In the Babylonian civilisation, historians and archaeologists have uncovered evidences where eye catching signs and paintings were displayed outdoors. Also, archaeologists have discovered evidences in Roman civilisation where signs were displayed outside homes offering property for rent. Later on, during medieval times merchants employed 'criers' who read public notices and also praised about the goods sold by their merchants. In modern times advertisement is shown through print media viz, newspaper, magazines, digital platforms i.e. radio, TV, internet etc. Advertisement facilitates large scale marketing. Some advertisements serve a public purpose by spreading awareness among the masses. They help in educating the viewer about an issue or a concern e.g. ‘Jago Grahak Jago’ campaign of Government of India Lifebuoy advertisement spreading awareness about maintaining hygiene at home and its impact on people's health is another such example. Another positive impact of advertisement is emphasis on social values through them e.g. awareness about the harmful effects of intoxicants such as tobacco or alcohol or drugs etc. Such advertisements have a social message for masses and it reaches far and wide all over the country. Through advertisements we can spread information or benefits of a campaign at a speed and with far reaching consequences. Advertisement can help in educating people such as the advertisement about polio drops to be given to the children. In India, polio eradication programme has been successful with the help of advertisements only. Advertising has some negative aspects also which can be harmful to people in many way as products which are endorsed by a celebrity does not ensure its quality. Sometimes, the product may not be of an excellent quality but because celebrity is advertising for it, common people tend to buy it which sometimes can be misleading Another negative aspect of advertisement is the hidden cost attached to the product or services. Products which are heavily advertised become expensive due to the cost spent on advertising Advertisement is often deceptive and misguides consumers. Exaggerated and false claims are made in the advertisements. Bogus testimonials and other questionable means are used to sell goods. Indigenous or local products tend to lose their market as they are lost in the glamour of celebrities endorsed brands. Ethical advertising is about being truthful concerning about the product or service and never exaggerating the capabilities of a product/service or hiding its flaws. As the markets run at cut-throat competition therefore, it is necessary for private companies to spend huge amounts of money on advertisement. But at the same time they have a corporate social responsibility, moral responsibility and ethical responsibility by not pushing products or services which are detrimental to the society. Products with adverse health benefits should be left to the wisdom of people Governments as a welfare and responsible authority should intervene in such critical aspects Similarly, it is also the responsibility of the celebrities to stop playing with emotions of people. We look upto them for many values, therefore they should not dupe people into using something which they do not believe in themselves. Advertisements should therefore encourage choice, create awareness, and lead us into living a better lifestyle. As these have a deep impact on psyche of people therefore advertisements should be value embedded and ethical. The educative advertisements should be publicised much to create awareness among people. To sum up we may say that advertising has positive as well as negative impact on society. The balance of between what is more important and what is really not needed' should be focussed more and practised accordingly.",      
    "Topic34": "The Indian cinema primarily emerged during the post-independence period. The Before this period, India produced only a few films such as Dada Saheb Phalke's Raja Harishchandra (1913), the first silent film in India and Alam Ara (1931), the first talking film, which was a superhit. Movies were also made in regional languages such as Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Malayalam, Oria etc. The post-independence period between 1940s and 1960s was regarded by film historians as Golden Age of Indian cinema. The films made during this period were thought provoking and emotionally enriching and delivering new ideas while keeping the basic Indian virtue intact. Those films created new expectations for the masses as the theme of films during this time was social issues and issues of national integration. Times and perception changed as filmmakers started produce films which people could easily associate and connect with. Factors such as new economic changes changed the film industry. Events such as liberalisation of economy in 1991 and entry of satellite television in 1992 changed the industry of cinema in India. It became more liberal, bringing in Western way of life, depicting exploitation, crimality etc. Film makers have become bolder as now the cinema tries to present the clear black and white picture of even the controversial issues rather than venturing into the grey side which shows a hazy picture. Indian cinema has an educative value. It exercises a deep influence upon the minds of the people. Cinema has the power to be an effective reformative instrument. It can expose the evils prevalent in the society such as girl foeticide, corruption, poverty, social unrest, illiteracy etc. The Indian cinema captivates the hearts and minds of young boys and girls that is why it is essential to use this medium wisely. Today's filmmakers have a social responsibility along with their entertainment and commercial interests. It is always good to see good quality cinema. It has a very positive and long lasting effect on the minds of people whereas movies that are shabby, affects the tender minds of people very badly. Bad cinema badly affects the thoughts of people but it doesn't mean that cinema should be discarded from the society. It has several roles to play in building a prosperous society. Cinema has great educative value. It can achieve splended results in the expansion of education. Various subjects can be taught with the help of cinema. Subjects such as history, geography, lessons on road sense, rules of hygiene, civic sense, respect for women, respecting diverse cultures etc. can be taught with the help of cinema more effectively. Cinemas and films have the power to influence the thinking of people. Indian cinema is the world's largest producer of films in various languages, dialects, portraying the lives of people in different ways Movies have changed societies and social trends. They have become trend setters by having direct impacts our social lives. Movies have been used by filmmakers for arousing national consciousness and also in utilising the energy of youth in social reconstruction and nation building Movies have been made on good moral, social and educative themes Cinema has been used to formulate and guide public opinion. Several films have been adopted from literary works. These films have successfully spread good literature among the common masses. It has also spread the practices of various cultures among the people. It imparts knowledge and understanding of lives and traditions of the people. Movies are an important source of information on History, civilisation, religions, social and economic aspects, politics etc. The social reality is depicted in the Indian cinema, sometimes realistically and sometimes according to the popular imagination. Thus, cinema is considered highly valuable for a society. As apart from entertainment medium, cinema has evolved itself into a diverse system that provides a large number of benefits to the society.",      
    "Topic35": "Indian cinema has undergone various changes from the producer of masala content towards movies that are focussed upon social issues and spread the message on issues affecting Indian society. It has reached new heights and simultaneously underwent various trends and new changes. Some of these changes are Single screen cinema theatres have been replaced by multiplexes that has increased the outreach of Indian cinema industry. Digitisation and the infusion of over the top technological platforms that can stream directly to our homes in our mobile devices have changed the landscape of Indian cinema. These video streaming platforms are advantageous for the viewers as they allow the Indian viewer to watch specific content of their choice at their own convenience. As these platforms are unregulated so, they allow more freedom and creative expression as compared to the traditional movie theatre release. The new has been marketing the films for wider audiences rather than particular segment. Now more movies are produced which are based on social cause and issues of several communities. More number of movies is being made on national issues that captures the imagination of people and highlights various political issues and opinions. Digital connectivity has enabled such movies to reach wider audience. Now large budget cinema is shifting towards low budget simple movies with modest cast rather than multi-hundred crore movies with star cast. The contribution of superstar cast movies has dropped and instead fresh talent has seen a rise. The cinema industry is also moving towards private producers from a predominantly production house dominated industry. In this individual movie, the producer has more creative freedom and takes lesser time to produce. The positive effects of cinema are as follows are Cinema has enabled the people of India to creatively express them in a language that can be understood by everyone. As cinema impacts the minds of people, it has the power to positively influence their minds and inculcate values of empathy, kindness, love, peace etc. It aids in spread of cultures and it allows people to be more respectful towards diversity, understand the issues and specific needs of other cultures. It enables intermixing of people of one culture with the others and thus allows for the emergence of a common national composite culture. Cinema also acts as an inspiration for the viewers. It makes the youth more compassionate and inspires them to help others and to do good to humanity. It encourages us to fight our personal pains and teaches us to behave properly with our peers even in pain. It encourages people to help others without seeking anything in return. Movies have always been used by creators to spread social awareness about various issues affecting the Indian society. Movies made on issues of women, war, drug abuse, crimes etc., have led to the creation of awareness in the society on these aspects. It has enabled people to discuss and find solutions to these issues more openly. Movies are a reflection of the existing culture prevailing in the society. It allows us to reflect upon ourselves. When the prevalent beliefs and ideologies are challenged by the movies, it is easier to interrogate ourselves, our attitude towards others, our strength and weaknesses and enables us to become agents of change. Cinema is used to connect the modern world with the past. A movie on history of our culture, civilisation etc. has the power to arouse our imagination and reflect back upon our history and society and their evolution till the modern times. It can be used to provide an alternative to a uniform culture promoted by one ideology. Thus, it helps us to recognise diversity in our history. Cinema is used to integrate the country on the basis of our common identities, simultaneously respecting and accepting the diversities. National issues and achievements are often reflected through the use of cinema and its production. The negative effects of cinema are as follows are Cinematic freedom has often been accused of overreach and promoting violence, nudity, racial discrimination, injustice, asympathy etc. Scenes full of violent behaviour are more common now in movies, which tends to influence young minds and makes them insensitive towards others. Cinema is used to stereotype religious practices, communities, gender roles, and creates tensions in the society. It is often abusive towards a particular community. It portrays one community against the other which may not be even the real picture but it can create social unrest. The actors are seen portraying an idealistic hero which may not be true of their personal characteristics in the real life. These actors are often viewed as role models but they are only acting for particular movie scenes. The young people create a false sense of idealistic men and women in their minds which proves detrimental when they discover realities. Commercialisation of cinema at a rapid pace also deprives it of the artistic values as it is only created for profitability. If focus shifts on the profitability of a movie rather than its content and then it becomes more of a commercialised movie rather than an artistic one. Often these movies portray controversies to get profitability which could create tensions in the society. The women are often used as commodities in popular cinema to gain more viewers. The growing tendency of film makers to use violent graphics, sexual imagery, vulgar scenes have further worsened the portrayal of women. The Indian cinema has grown significantly after the Independence of India. It has influenced the people, society and culture of India since the beginning and in turn has been influenced by it too. It has become a powerful tool of mass communication, political mobilisation, social justice and opinion formation. The cinema of India has the power to address various social issues. The issue of piracy still affects Indian cinema. Moreover, films have also been accused of promoting harmful behaviours. Thus, there is need to work upon these issues so that cinema can play its role more effectively in a society.",      
    "Topic36": "The term 'euthanasia' comes from the Greek word 'euthanatos' meaning 'good death' It is an act or practice of ending the life of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition. It is also known as 'mercy killing' which is an act where the individual who has no chance of survival as he is suffering from painful life, ends his life in a painless manner. It is a gentle, easy and painless death. It is basically to bring about the death of a terminally ill patient or a disabled Euthanasia is thus practised so that a person can live as well as die with dignity. There are two types of euthanasia namely; active euthanasia and passive euthanasia Active euthanasia or positive euthanasia refers to causing intentional death of a human being by direct intervention. It is a direct action performed to end useless life and a meaningless existence. For example by giving lethal dose of a drug or by giving a lethal injection on the other hand, passive euthanasia or negative euthanasia is intentionally causing death by not providing essential, necessary and ordinary care or food and water. It implies to discontinuing, withdrawing or removing artificial life support system. Passive euthanasia is usually slower and more uncomfortable than active. Before moving further, it is important to note that there is a difference between 'Suicide' and 'Euthanasia'. In a suicide, a man voluntarily kills himself by stabbing, poisoning or by any other mean. It is an act of intentionally killing oneself due to depression or other reasons. On the other hand, euthanasia is an action of a person to bring to an end the life of another person. Another major difference to be studied is between 'assisted suicide' and 'euthanasia. Assisted suicide is an act which intentionally helps another to commit suicide. For Example, by providing with the means to do so When it is a doctor who helps a patient to kill himself by providing a prescription for lethal medication, it is a 'physician assisted suicide On the other hand, euthanasia may be active such as when a doctor gives a lethal injection to a patient or passive when a doctor removes life support system of the patient. Now, the matter of concern is the legalisation of euthanasia. In countries like Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, active euthanasia is legal. Passive euthanasia is allowed in the UK, the USA and Canada. In India, the question of legalising euthanasia came during the case of state of Maharashtra /v/s Maruti Shripathi Desai. After the decision of Supreme Court in Aruna Shanbaug case, 2011, a nurse who was in a vegetative state for 37 years as a result of sexual assault, passive euthanasia was legalised in India. India allowed 'passive euthanasia' in exceptional cases on 7th march, 2011 after a review by medical experts, while 'active euthanasia' is not allowed. This landmark decision legalised passive euthanasia, giving thousands of patients living in a persistant vegetative state all over the country, the right to have artificial life-support system withdrawn so as to enable them to end a life of misery. The court held that there is no right to die under Article 21 of the Constitution but causing the death of a person who is in a permanent persistant vegetative state, with no chance of recovery, by withdrawing artificial life support is not a 'positive act of killing. Terming this 'passive euthanasia', a bench of justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Mishra held that this could be permitted on a case by case basis. Guidelines for Passive Euthanasia The court also laid down guidelines for passive euthanasia. The matter must be referred to the High Court for a decision and that the doctor or the parents or spouse of the patient must be one of the petitioners for the withdrawal of life support system. A special two-judge bench will be formed in every High Court to decide applications seeking permission for euthanasia. A committee of three reputed doctors from a panel constituted by the High Court in consultation with the State Government will examine the patient and submit its report to the High Court bench. Notices will be issued to all those concerned with the doctor's report attached. After hearing everyone, the bench will give its verdict. The matter must be dealt speedily as delays prolong the agony of the patient. The Supreme Court declared passive euthanasia and the right of persons, including the terminally ill, to give advance directives to refuse medical treatment permissible. The Supreme Court in its judgement upheld that the Fundamental Right to a 'meaningful existence' includes a person's choice to die without suffering. It is in consonance with the Article 21 of the Constitution which provides for living with dignity and if that standard is falling below that minimum level then a person should be given a right to end his life. It not only relieves the unbearable pain of a patient but also relieves the relatives of a patient from the mental agony. It provides a way to relieve the intolerably extreme pain and suffering of an individual. On the other hand, many people are against legalising euthanasia. They believe that the human life is gift of God and taking life is wrong and immoral human beings cannot be given the right to play the part of God Acceptance of euthanasia as an option could exercise a detrimental effect on societal attitudes and on the doctor-patient relationship, Miracles do happen when it is a matter of life and death, there are examples of patients coming out of coma after y years. It is feared that if euthanasia is legalised then other groups of more vulnerable people will become at risk of feeling into taking that option themselves.",      
    "Topic37": "Millions of people in India are born with existing scars that may not fadele their lifetime or over next generations. In the Hindu society of India, people are born in certain families, by the accident of birth that is as having lower status in the society. There are the shudras, also termed as Dalits already looked upon or the untouchables. These people are socially stigmatised and economically backward as they are forced to perform menial jobs for the upper caste people. These people are discriminated and socially excluded, which means that they are not allowed to fully participate in the public and community life, which also has several adverse consequences upon their growth and development. The caste system in Hinduism encompasses a complex ordering of social groups on the basis of ritual purity. A person is considered as a member of the caste into which he/she is born and remains within that caste until death. Differences in the status are traditionally justified by the doctrine of Karma, a belief that one's place in life is determined by one's deeds of previous lifetime. Though, the practice of untouchability has been abolished by the constitution, yet the imposition of social disabilities on people by reason of birth into a particular caste remains the part of lives of people in India Discrimination and exclusion on the basis of caste is hereditary in India. If a particular caste is seen as untouchable, then all the members of that community face discrimination, whatever is the occupation of the member of that caste. Discrimination and exclusion have deeper roots in Indian society. That is why even when there have been various legislations that prohibit discrimination on the basis of caste, yet it has not been eradicated completely. This discrimination and exclusion manifests itself in several forms. These may be social, economic or political. In the social hierarchy, the lower castes are ascribed the lowest status. It means that they are considered as unholy, inferior and polluting. Even their touch is considered as polluting by the upper castes. Hence, they are exploited and discriminated and often they are beaten if they come in contact with the people of higher castes. They were made to perform unclean jobs such as washing clothes, avenging tanning, shoe making, removing dead animals etc. They were not allowed to use public spaces and avail facilities such as common wells, ponds, temples, schools, hostels, hospitals, dharamshalas etc. They were forced to live on the outskirts of the town and villages during earlier days. Even now, their houses are physically separated from those of the upper caste houses. They were allowed to work as labourers in the houses of the upper caste people but later the house was purified using cow dung or cow urine or holy river water. In South India restrictions were imposed on the way of their dressing, types of their houses and even the ornaments they can wear. They were sometimes not allowed to cover their upper bodies, Higher education was denied to them. Even now many dalits face discrimination in educational institutions. They are not able to avail of opportunities that are available to the upper caste people studying in the same education institution. Even now the literacy levels among the scheduled castes are too low. These castes have also been denied religious services. This practice exists even today and many people from the lower castes cannot attend religious ceremonies in various temples of India. The Vedic mantras could not be listened to by the impure' castes. They were even denied burial ground in various regions of India. For centuries, the untouchables were not allowed to own land and houses of their own. It is after the democratisation of India after its independence that their right to property has been recognised. Still the propertied class among the untouchables is quite low. Majority of the workforce in India is engaged in agriculture but the dalits still own very less agricultural lands as compared to other castes. Many of the untouchable castes today work as landless labourers. A large number of lower caste families are debt ridden. Though their economic conditions have improved but they have not improved in synchronisation with the changing times and changes in the economy. Hence, still they are economically exploited by the upper castes. The caste system also imposes certain restrictions on the lower caste people. They are not allowed to mobilise up the social and economic ladder. Whatever traditional occupations they were carrying on, they are not allowed to change those occupations. They are forced to take up only those occupations which are reserved for them. Though seats have been reserved for them in various government sector occupations yet they make up only a small proportion of the overall workforce. Moreover, mostly the lower castes are occupying the lower level jobs in government services. The untouchables rarely participated in the political matters. Earlier, they were not allowed to hold public positions. Political representation was denied to them. After independence, seats in the Parliament and State Legislatures were reserved for the But they are yet to become a decisive force in the Indian politics. There has not coherent been much influence of lower castes at the national level politics. Their influence has mostly been localised only barring a few political groups that have succeeded at the national level too. Mostly the lower castes have not been able to organise themselves at the national level. Thus, they are still excluded from the political power sharing. There have been only very few instances where a scheduled caste member has won a seat in Legislature or Parliament at the national level or at state level from a general category seat. Often the lower castes find themselves at the odd end in a quarrel between the upper and lower castes. In the power tussle they are made scapegoats and denied even the basic human dignity. It is a well-known fact that lower caste victims are often treated as perpetrators of crime and denied justice Moreover, they are exploited, insulted and humiliated by the criminal justice system. Caste system hinders national unity. People become conscious of their own caste and prioritise their caste and class interests over national interests. It is against the democratic spirit. India is seen internationally as the champion of democracy in the world. If the citizens are discriminating against each other, it defeats the spirit of democracy, Democracy is based on equal rights and respects but the caste system believes in a hierarchical arrangement where the upper castes enjoy more privileges and lower castes are looked as inferior. It results in suppression of individual liberty and dignity. The dignity of the lower castes people is not respected as they are denied basic human rights such as right to livelihood and right to food. Inter-dining and inter-mixing of upper castes with lower castes was not allowed earlier and this practice is still prevalent in some backward regions of India. The caste system is thus against the idea of national development. In the national interest it is essential that all the sections of the society should contribute to the social welfare and national economy but the caste system views the lower caste people as unequals and denies them a voice in national development and economic advancement. The hierarchial system of caste and the discrimination that the people of the lower caste face in their everyday lives undermines their abilities and aspirations Acceptance of one's social status becomes mandatory and unquestionable. Thus, caste of the people is given more importance in the society as compared to their abilities and capabilities and one's ability, talent, personal endeavour becomes meaningless. It has also resulted in the monopoly of the upper castes over knowledge, education and wisdom. This has created a wide gulf between the upper and the lower castes. It is again a hinderance to the national development. Caste based discrimination has also led to the emergence of other forms of exclusions and discriminations. For e.g. women among the lower castes is more discriminated upon. They are exploited physically as well as mentally. They are forced to follow certain rituals against their wishes. Thus, the prevalence of caste based discrimination has made some citizens unequal as compared to others in a democratic nation. Though various legislations have been passed by the Parliament and the State Legislatures yet caste discrimination exists in India. The following measures can be taken to eliminate this evil from Indian society. Policies should be designed and implemented that specifically aim to challenge the discrimination on the basis of caste. One important point to note here is that there must be effective participation and consultation of those communities that have been exploited for centuries on the basis of caste. Thus, this decentralised approach is necessary as compared to the earlier top down approach where policies were made at the top level without any representation from the affected castes. Platforms should be built at the national as well as local levels that should specifically be used to build the capacity of the communities who are victims of the caste based discrimination. These programs should be regularly monitored and their deficiencies should be analysed so that they can be improved. Providing reservations without further support will not work. Institutional discrimination should be tackled at every level. Institutions, be it government or private, which promotes caste based discrimination should be reprimanded and counselled so that a human rights approach can be promoted towards those people who are or have been discriminated and disabilities imposed upon them on the basis of caste. Good housing facilities with provision of basic services shall be built for the lower castes so that they are not deprived of their right to shelter. These houses should not be built on separate lands or lands away from the upper caste houses but they should be constructed in a way that the lower castes and upper castes live in the same piece of land and in complete harmony.  Caste bias should be removed from the minds of public servants such as police, judiciary, civil servants, legislators etc., so that the lower caste discrimination is not institutionalised. To completely eliminate caste based discrimination, the current laws and justice providing institutions should be strengthened further so that the lower castes are not denied their equal rights as equal citizens of India. There should be a national level platform where dialogue between the representatives of upper and lower castes should be promoted so that the historical bitterness can be dissolved and a message of peace and harmony on the basis of democratic rights, equality and human dignity can be spread. Despite many reforms and government regulations it is unfortunate that caste system in India still exists. We as citizens must take cautious steps and uphold discrimination as a serious offence. It is essential to eliminate caste discrimination before it eliminates the unity of India.",      
    "Topic38": "The polity of India is unique in the sense that it has involved the traditions of democratic debate and discussions. The Indian politics is continuously evolving during the course of evolution of democracy; the Indian politics has witnessed a wider participation of different stakeholders including the students. The role of the youth in shaping the course of any democracy is undeniable. More than 50 per cent of India's population is below the age of 25, and more than 65 per cent below 35. Given that democracy is the will of the majority, and the majority of India's population nearly 400 million voters is the youth, it is essential to look at the way this majority can be harnessed to participate in democracy and contribute towards the development of the country. Student politics aims to infuse the democratic principles among young generation. Students and politics have always been the core of almost all the revolutions that have taken place. Once the student starts taking interest in the politics of his country, the change is bound to come. In India, student movements have more than 150 years of history. In 1848, Dadabhai Naroji founded the 'Student's Literary and Scientific Society', as a forum for discussion. This can be considered to be beginning of student movements in India. The first student strike happened at King Edward Medical College, Lahore, regarding academic discrimination between the English people and Indians. This strike was a complete success as the part of the freedom struggle there were so many student movements emerged and engaged in it. Swadeshi Movement (1905) was the beginning of the Indian Student Movement. This gave students a revolutionary outlook which called them to boycott colleges as well as British goods. The All India College Students Conference was held at Nagpur in 1920 and the resolution on non-cooperation and boycott of schools and colleges is passed with an overwhelming majority. In addition to this, youngsters played an important role in shaping political discourse during Civil Disobedience Movement and Quit India Movement. The Independence of our nation was one of the turning points of the student politics in India. There was a marked change of perspective within the leadership of the student movements. In the place of the mass student organisations, a number of local groups mostly of an ad-hoc nature developed. Agitations have tended to be localised forced on university issues or local political conflicts, rather than on rational or broader ideological questions. The different student movements emerged in different states or a specified locality. The Nav Nirman Student Movement in Gujarat (1973), Bihar Student Movement (1974), Assam Student Movement (1979) and All Jharkhand Students Union (1986) are the examples of youngsters participating in political movement. Several Universities have witnessed a burst in student protests in last few years. The reason for students protest does vary owing to local or national issues. The student bodies like students union give representation to demands of students. The Jadhavpur University Protest (2014) that demanded an investigation into molestation of a female student, and the JNU protests (2019) against fee hike are the recent examples. Young people are often excluded or overlooked as political candidates. It is important to note that in the new democracies like India, the role of youth is of special importance. Politics is typically regarded as a space for politically experienced men. Young people are systematically marginalised because of their young age, limited opportunities, and projected lack of experience. However, the presence of young people in decision-making positions benefits all citizens and not just youth. They bring a wide array of ideas. The novelty which accompanies the youth must be welcomed in politics. Statistics explain that even if half of the governing powers come under control of sensible educated people, then a combined effort of old experienced people as well as young educated minds would increase the development rates to 40% Not just talking about Indian politics but also matters like inter country business or maintaining relations with other nations, it is important for the youth to take participation in it as they can think above the traditional ways and easily adapt to the modern ways of development. The purpose of an educational institution is not only to instruct the curriculum but also to produce equally responsible and aware citizens by facilitating dialectical research. Students use their political platforms, under the norms and values of democracy Student politicians question the laws and policies, if they are against larger good of society. Further, they advocate social justice. Furthermore, student politics help in making aware of their rights and act as a link between masses and the administration. In the past, youth leaders like Gagan Thapa, JM Namgyal and others have tirelessly fought for progressive principles such as republicanism, federalism and inclusive democracy. Student's groups participating in student politics are often blank in ideology and do not address the issues of national concern. The organisational structure and the activities of the student unions seem obsolete in the context of the social and political reforms in the country. Many student unions don't reflect the inclusiveness and wider participation from all sections of the society. Also, many a times, student using the banner of a certain mainstream political party act as proxies and only push agenda relating to their ideologies, even at the cost of democratic ethos. Furthermore, many a times, students engage themselves in violence and abuse. Before Independence it was repeatedly declared that youngsters must have a very acute and alert consciousness and be ready for any type of involvement to achieve freedom. After Independence, the picture seems to have changed and now it is being said that students' main concern is academic pursuits However, students cannot live in isolation or in a sort of social vacuum. The student agitation on various issues resonates the same. Hence, the role of youth in politics is to interpret changes in society that are beneficial to all citizens.",      
    "Topic39": "According to Census 2011, there are nearly 104 million elderly persons (aged A60 years or above) in India; 53 million females and 51 million males. Both are the share and size of elderly population is increasing over time. A report jointly brought out by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and Help Age International says that India's population is likely to increase by 60% between 2000 and 2050 but the number of elders, who have attained 60 years of age, will shoot up by 360% and the government should start framing policies now else its consequences are likely to take it by surprise. India has around 100 million elderly at present and the number is expected to increase to 323 million, constituting 20% of the total population by 2050. Government of India adopted National Policy on Older Persons' in January 1999. The policy defines 'senior citizen' or 'elderly' as a person who is of age 60 years or above. Also, as per Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, senior citizen means any person being a citizen of India, who has attained the age of 60 years or above. The goal of the National Policy is the well-being of older persons. It aims to strengthen their legitimate place in society and help older persons to live the last phase of their life with purpose, dignity & peace. The traditional norms and values of Indian society laid stress on showing respect and providing care for the elderly. Consequently, the older members of the family were normally taken care of in the family itself. The advent of modernisation, industrialisation, urbanisation, occupational differentiation, education and growth of individual philosophy has eroded the traditional values that vested authority with elderly. Various social and economic problems are associated with the old age. In modern society, improved education, rapid technical changes and new forms of organization have often rendered obsolete the knowledge, experience and wisdom of the aged people. Once they retire, elderly people find that their children are not taking advice from them. This realization often results in feeling loss of status, worthlessness and loneliness. Now a days some children send their parents to old age homes, so that they don’t have to take care of them Family care of the elderly seems likely to decrease in the future with the economic development of the nation and modernisation The elderly, especially those who are weak and dependent, require physical, mental and emotional care and support When this is not provided, they suffer from neglect, a problem that occurs when a person is left uncared for and that is often linked with isolation If the elderly are economically dependent on children, the problem becomes worse. Financial insecurity is one of the most crucial challenges faced by the aged people Pension and social security is restricted to those who have worked in the public sector or the organized sector Old age is a period of disappointment, dejection, disease, repentance and loneliness. The best way to address neglect of the elderly is to counsel families, sensitive community leaders and address the issue at all levels in different forums. These are many schemes that the Government of India initiated for the welfare of old age people in India. Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana (RVY) scheme is run by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. It provides aids and assistive living devices to senior citizens belonging to BPL category. This scheme was launched in 2016. Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana (VPBY) Run by the Ministry of Finance, the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana was launched in 2014. It is intended to give an assured minimum pension on a guaranteed minimum return on the subscription amount. Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) was launched in May 2017 to provide social security during old age. It assures minimum 8% per annum pension to old age people Vayoshreshtha Sammans Conferred as a National Award for senior citizens and was launched in 2005. It is applicable for eminent senior citizens and institutes involved in distinguished services for the cause of elderly persons National Programme for Healthcare of Elderly (NPHCE) Keeping in view the recommendations made in the National Policy on Older Persons, 1999 as well as the state's obligation under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens, 2007, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had launched the National Programme for health care of the elderly during the 11th Plan period to address various health related problems of elderly people. In today's fast moving world, old age homes should not be looked down upon totally. They can be a secure place for the parents of those children who are working out of India or in some other distant city where they cannot visit or look after their parents regularly. However to opt for an old age home, choice should be left to the parents. We can also opt for many creative ideas like play houses and old age homes to be made together so that the children also get old people to talk to and old people can also have a good time. Such ideas are always best for community as a whole.",      
    "Topic40": "More and more young people worldwide are growing up in an environment that is increasingly becoming tolerant of various forms of substance use to promote a climate of 'solution by ingestion'. The tobacco and alcohol industry has added to this environment by utilising their powerful marketing strategies influencing young people. Youth may also be influenced by their peer groups and if the peers are involved in any kind of substance or drug use, then it is highly likely that the individual will indulge in such behaviour. Adolescent beliefs about drug use and risks tend to change rapidly with rising tolerance levels about drugs Easy availability of drugs and access to them exacerbates the situations and puts the younger generation at risks. Even a single drug use experience, known as experimental dose may result in overdose, an accident or even criminal prosecution that has a profound impact on the minds of the young people. The term 'drug' has now been given a new connotation. It was used originally to mean 'medicine. However, nowadays the term 'drug' means not only medicine but also the fatal narcotics that include cocaine, heroin, brown sugar and many other specifications. All these drugs have their evil effects on the mind and body cells of the addicts. Drug addiction implies physical dependence upon a drug including the development of tolerance and withdrawal. The young generations particularly teenagers are the worst victims of evils of Drug Addiction. When a drug is taken for the first time, it stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain. It is for sake of pleasure that most users first get accustomed to it. They take drugs to forget pain, sorrow, insult and to escape from reality. Drugs are taken in various forms. Some are taken through injection, some are smoked and some are chewed and swallowed. An addict who develops tolerance requires more of the drug to transport him to the world of fantasies. If the addict is not allowed to take the drug, he suffers from painful and uncontrollable convulsions, vomiting, depression and various other maladies. It has been discovered that most people who struggle with drug addiction began experimenting with drugs in their teens. Many teens have heard about drugs and they are curious to experience them for themselves and later they become addicted to it. The addict becomes dependent on the drug, he uses it, despite having full knowledge of its harmful effects on health. There is uncontrollable desire or craving to consume the drug and they find it impossible to control the drug intake. In case of drug abuse, people start taking drugs in larger doses than the recommended doses. The addict is not able to discharge his day-to-day responsibilities in an efficient manner as it affects physical as well as mental health of the person. Besides, ruining an addict morally, it also affects him physically. Drug addiction is associated with a range of short and long term physical as well as psychological effects. Drug addiction impacts almost all the organs of body in a significant manner. The effects of drug abuse and addiction include drug abuse and addiction increases the risk of severe illness and infection as it weakens the immune response of the body. It leads to abnormal heart rates and heart attacks, and collapsed veins and blood vessels infections due to injected drugs. • There is increased strain on liver, which puts the person at higher risk of liver damage and failure. There are memory losses, attention and decision making is affected, and increased chances of seizures, stroke, mental confusion and brain damage. Drugs alter the brain chemistry, causes loss of appetite, strength and stamina. Mood, behaviour and other essential cognitive functions are also affected by drug dosage. There is loss of self-control, impaired judgements, aggressiveness, paranoia etc. There is often impaired concentration and coordination, abnormal breathing, and increase in body temperatures. Drug addiction also causes lung, throat, mouth and tongue cancers, increased risks of infertility and damages to nasal passages. When the youth loses control over their minds and brain because of drug addiction, they often indulge in risky behaviours such as social crimes, anti-social activities etc. Young people often waste their academic and employment opportunities because of drug addiction. Addiction also results in damaged relationships that impact social well-being of younger people. The following factors are responsible for drug addiction among youth. Teenagers and young people use drugs because of the influence of their peers. They think that others are doing it and that is why they fear non-acceptance in a social circle that includes drug abusing peers. Drugs influence the neurochemistry of brain to produces feelings of pleasure and relieves the person from stress and anxiety. Adolescents particularly suffer from depressions, stress related disorders and physical pains. Using drugs is an attempt to lessen these feelings of distress. Stress plays a significant role in starting and sustaining drug abuse. Adolescents and younger people are motivated to seek new experiences, particularly those which are thrilling or daring. This puts them at risk of drug addiction and later drug abuse because they seek to experiment with new substances. Drugs and harmful substances are easily accessible to young people. They are available to the younger people through hidden and illegal channels. Low self-esteem in teenagers and young people leads to self-destructive behaviour to act or look like in a certain way. They lose confidence in themselves if they are unable to meet high standards. Drugs and alcohol seems like an easy option to them to escape this reality. Adults, under the influence of popular culture and to look and feel 'cool', use drugs and substances which are harmful to them. Movies, popular media, social media, TV shows etc. make drugs look like an acceptable act. This is why the popularity of drugs among youth has risen. The processes of industrialisation, urbanisation and migration have led to loosening of the traditional methods of social control rendering an individual vulnerable to the stresses and strains of modern life. Drug addiction among youth can be prevented if the youth are taught of its harmful consequences. Also, support from family members is a must as they are the closest to the individual Family should support their child to understand what he/she is going through and what compelled them to take such a risky step. Parents should try to motivate their children and understand what they really want in life. Every child is different from the other and parents should really try to understand their children's expectation to avoid any cases related to alcohol or drug abuse. Prevention programmes involving entities such as families, schools and the immediate communities are important in this regard. Media, especially the entertainment segment, also needs to understand its role in this context, glorification of drug use should completely stop. Role of NGOs is also important to fight this menace. There is an urgent requirement of strict laws and regulations in breaking the chain of hidden, illegal networks used to supply drugs to individuals. Each and every stakeholder involved in the fight against drug addiction and abuse should contribute towards the fight and establish a drug free society.",      
    "Topic41": "An honour killing is the homicide (murder) of a member of a family by other members as it is believed that the victim has brought shame or dishonour upon the family or the community he/she belongs to. Honour killing is one of the types of cultural crimes present in our country. Cultural crimes are basically the crimes that seek to take place within the context of culture or under the head of it. Honour killing usually is committed by male family members against female family members, who are held to have brought dishonour upon the family. However men can also be the victims of honour killing. The term 'honour killing' applies to both men and women in cultures that practice it. The distinctive nature of honour killing is the collective nature of the crime the means many members of an extended family or community plan the act together and then commit the crime. Honour killings are directed mostly against women and girls. According to statistics, honour killings have been reported in Northern regions of mainly in the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It is prevalent to a lesser extent in South India and the Western Indian states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. In West Bengal, honour killings completely ceased about a century age, due to active steps taken by reformers. There are various reasons why people or family members decide to kill the daughter in the name of preserving their family honour. The most obvious reasons are refusing to enter an arranged marriage, being in a relationship that is disapproved by the family, having sex outside marriage, being rape victim, dressing in a way which i viewed as inappropriate, renouncing a faith etc. Sociologists believe that the reason why honour killings continue to take place le because of the continued rigidity of the caste system. Hence, the fears of losing their caste status through which they pain many benefits and earn a respect in society make them commit his heinous crime. The other reason why honour killings are taking place is because the mentality of people has not changed and they just cannot accept that marriages can take place in the same goera or outside one's caste. The other side of the story points fingers towards the role played by Khap Panchayats in honour killing. These panchayats are self-driven set ups that have gained wicked popularity for having paved a way for honour killing Boycotting families from villages that choose to allow their children to get married by their choice and supporting the families in honour killing are some of the devilish activities of these panchayats. The unlawful laws of the Khap panchayats are imposed through social beycotts where the victims are killed or forced to commit suicide. All these inhumane activities are done in the name of brotherhood and honour of the community Love marriages are considered a taboo in these areas. The famous Manoj Babli honour killing case in June, 2007, for the first time convicted the defendants for honour killing case. This killing was ordered by a Khap Panchayat in Haryana. On 30th March, 2010 for the first time in Haryana state history, a death penalty verdict was announced in this double murder case for the five accused. It is important to note that honour killing is not specific to India only. It continues to be prevailing in other parts of the world too. Reports submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) show that honour killings have occurred in countries like Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, Israel, Italy, Jorden, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey and Uganda 'Honour killing' is a recognised form of violence against women in international human rights law because it violates women's right to life and security and as well as every other article in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Honour killings also violate the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (1979). This convention has been signed by 185 countries worldwide over 90% of the members of the United Nations including most countries where 'honour killing occurs India is also a part of the signatories. In India, honour killings are homicide and murder which are serious crimes under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The perpetrators can be punished as per Section 302 of the IPC. The members as well as the community can be prosecuted under Section 302 of IPC. Apart from this, honour killing also violates Articles 14, 15(1) and (3), 19, 21 and 39(1) of the Constitution of India. On the other hand the Supreme Court in a judgement on 19th April, 2012 has termed the Khap panchayats illegal and has directed the State Governments to take strong measures to prevent any atrocious acts by the Khap panchayats. Alarmed by the rise of honour killings, the Government of India assigned the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) to collect data on honour killings since January 2014. The Commission has submitted its 242 pages report titled as ‘Prevention of Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances’. It has recommended for bringing a legislation namely ‘The Prohibition of Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliance Bill’ to curb the social evil of the caste councils/panchayats interference and endangerment of the life and liberty of young person marrying partners belonging to the same gotra or to a different caste or religion. The need of the hour is to check such incidences with full force. The problem must be tackled at several fronts. Firstly, the mentality of the people has to change. The government too should make sincere efforts to educate the people and formulate the policies thereby strengthening the governance of rule of law. There is a need for media to lend a hand in creating local awareness about the horror of honour crimes. Therefore, honour killing is not justified in any manner and it should be stopped with immediate effect.",      
    "Topic42": "It is rightly said that ‘If we educate a man, we educate a man only, but if we educate a woman, we educate the whole family’. Education plays a major role in the social and economic growth of a nation. A nation can be educated in the real sense of the term, when its entire population is educated. Mostly people think that men's contribution in society is more than women. But now women are sharing equal responsibility in every field of society. So, female education is important for all round progress of a country. If we want to make democracy successful, woman must be educated. They are the real builders of happy homes. Women education is very important because women are the first teacher of their children as they receive the very first lessons in their mother's lap. Hence, if mothers are educated, they can perfectly shape and mould their sons and daughters. An educated mother will have high expectations for her children's educational success and will continuously encourage them to develop high expectations of their own. An educated mother is more likely to have health knowledge ensuring her children receive the proper vaccines for their health and provide healthy meals that are nutritionally beneficial. Significance of Female Education in Different Fields Education enhances the intellectual, social and emotional development of women and enables them to meet their basic needs of daily life. It helps in reducing inequalities in the society. Apart from this, educated women help to reduce the population of a nation as they have great confidence that enables to take right decisions. They also help to reduce child and maternal mortality. They are less likely to be taken advantage of and lower exposure to domestic abuse. All this contributes in a positive way to the society and the nation at large. Educated women can shoulder any kind of responsibility. See the examples like Kalpana Chawla, Kiran Bedi, Sushma Swaraj etc. they have earned a name in the society for themselves. Education for a girl child means making the next generation well educated, full of virtues, free from the useless superstitions, confident and capable to do something good for the family, for the society and for the country as a whole. Till now female education is not given much importance in many parts of India. Some of the reasons are dowry, child marriage, caste system and purdah system prevalent in the society. Many people in the rural areas are of belief that money would be needed during her marriage to be given as dowry, so investing the money for her education is regarded as waste. Another reason for the deprivation of girl's education is the child marriage. It is a great belief in India that for a girl it is more important to become perfect in household works than getting education. This forces the girl to focus towards household work. At many places the caste system is so strong that the girls of lower caste are not allowed to go to the schools where the girls of the high caste are studying. If you look at the percentage of educated people, there is a huge gap between male and female literacy rate in India. According to the census 2011, the percentage of literate male is 82.14% and female is 65.46%. Among the states, the female literacy rate is highest in Kerala and Mizoram with 91.98% and 89.40% respectively whereas Rajasthan has the lowest female literacy with 52.66%. The reason behind the high literacy rate of Kerala is the modern policies adopted by the governments and modern social beliefs that justify girl's education. The aided-school policy adopted by the EMS Namboodiripad government paved way for private entrepreneurs to start up schools with government aiding On the other hand, the reason for low female literacy rate in a state like Rajasthan is social belief that makes boy's education more important. The tradition of child marriage prevalent in the state is another factor for such a low rate. The Government of India has initiated various programmes and policies to ensure that a girl does not miss out any opportunity of getting education. After independence, the government had set up a National Committee on Women's Education in 1958 and it recommended that female education should be at par with male education Some of the important schemes/policies initiated by the Government of India for girl's education are Sakshar Bharat Mission for female literacy launched in 2008 for promoting adult education especially among women under which Lok Shiksha Kendras were set up. Kasturba Balika Vidyalaya for establishment of residential upper primary schools for girl. National programme for education of girls at elementary level for reduction in the school dropouts by giving special attention to weak girls Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikasha Abhiyan to provide infrastructure for girls hostel for secondary education. The Balika Samriddhi Yojana is a scholarship scheme designed to provide financial support to young girls and their mothers who are below the poverty line. Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao started in 2015 aims to generate awareness and improving the efficiency of welfare services meant for women. Sukanya Samridhi Yojana launched in 2015 under the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign to meet the expense of the girl child's higher education and marriage. The present day girl is the mother of tomorrow. She is the most crucial and reverend entity. She must be given all the necessary education without ignoring her. Keeping her illiterate means we are creating an illiterate and ignorant generation. So, it is perfectly true that educating a girl child means educating a family. Development cannot be accelerated unless girls are given right education in right direction. Swami Vivekananda has rightly said, ‘Educate your women first and leave them to themselves, they will tell you what reforms are needed’.",      
    "Topic43": "India has the distinction of being the largest democracy in the world and I election is an integral component of the democratic system. A successful democracy is based on free and fair elections and not on the rigged and manipulated ones. While politics is the art and practice of dealing with the political power, the election is a process of legitimisation of such power. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a permanent constitutional body that was established on 25th January, 1950. The ECI is the guardian of free and fair elections in India. Post-independence, the elections are held after every five years at the state and national levels to choose the representatives of the people and to elect the government. The Article 326 of the Indian Constitution deals with election to the House of People and to the Legislative Assemblies of the state. Over the years, there have been a number of electoral reforms in India. The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 years by the Amendment to the Constitution (Sixty-first Amendment) Act, 1988 and this enfranchised a whole new generation of voters. Under the Representation of People Act, 1951 a new Section 13CC was added, which provides that the officers or staff engaged in the preparation, revision and correction of electoral rolls for elections shall be deemed to be on deputation of Election Commission for the period of such employment and such personnel during that period, be subject to the control, superintendence and discipline of Election Commission. Besides, the number of electors who were required to sign as proposers in nomination papers for elections to the Council of States and Legislative Council have been increased to 10 per cent of the electors of the constituency or ten such electors whichever is less to prevent frivolous candidates. The Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) was used as an experimental basis for first time in Assembly constituencies in states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and New Delhi for the general elections in November, 1988. The Election Commission was empowered under Article 324 of the Constitution to use EVM during elections and it successfully accomplished the vital task of the introduction of photo identity cards for all the voters in the country. This has been successful weeding out the bogus and duplicate entries during the elections. The NOTA option was used for the first time in the Assembly Elections held in five states in 2013. It was introduced in the electronic voting machines after the honourable Supreme Court delivered the landmark judgement in Peoples' Union for Civil Liberties vs. Union of India Case. The option of NOTA upheld and recognised the rights of the citizens to not cast a vote which maintaining his secrecy during such abstinence. The true spirit of democracy lies in giving the citizens power to exercise their rights. NOTA replaced the process of filling the form 17(A), which was used in order to cast a negative vote. The elections have become synonymous with corruption, communalism, violence and power. The criminalisation of politics has led to the misuse of money and power. It is tough to expect fair and just decisions when the law breakers have become the law makers. The inclusion of anti-social elements in the legislative assemblies have diluted the essence of democracy and led to a feeble electoral system. Money power has a baneful influence on the elections in the country. In fact, it has undermined our democratic system. The voters are purchased like saleable commodities and caste and religion have a decisive influence on the ultimate wrong voting behaviour and election results. The leaders elected on the religious and caste lines are apt to show favours to the adherents of their caste and religion. It has been seen and often reported that the employees preparing electoral rolls sometimes deliberately ignore certain section of voters by their names and not entering them in the electoral rolls at the insistence of interested parties. On account of emergence of the coalition era, stability of our governments both at the state and country level has gone to the winds. Hence, there are too frequent elections and the voters develop a sort of electoral fatigue. Even the dead and absentee voters could be impersonated with the connivance of their families and some polling officers. Too many candidates in the fray for elections is said to be the glaring defect of electoral system in India because it spoils the chance of good candidates winning the elections All these defects of our electoral system induce our political analysts to clamour for electoral reforms so that our democratic edifice attains stability and the representatives elected may render dedicated service to the nation. A number of committees have been appointed to examine the issues and the major challenges affecting the Indian Electoral System. The committees include the Goswami Committee on Electoral Reforms (1990), the Vohra Committee (1993). the Indrajit Gupta Committee on State Funding of Elections (1998), the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2001), the ECI Proposed Electoral Reforms (2004), the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC- 2008) and the Law Commission of India. All these committees pointed towards the divergence and irregularities in the election process and then male recommendations for its implementations. Despite several reforms initiated, these issues are still paralysing the Indian Electoral system for decades. The Section 8 of Representation of People Act strongly advocates for the disqualification of candidates with criminal background. But as per the Section 8, a person is disqualified from elections only on conviction by a court of law. The Election Commission has repeatedly proposed the amendment of this law to provide that any person who is accused of a punishable offence by imprisonment for 5 years or more should be disqualified from contesting the elections. The Election Commission strongly advocates for the fact that this will play an important role in cleaning up the Indian political system. In July, 2013, the honourable Supreme Court gave a ruling that the MPs and MLAs who were convicted of serious crimes be barred from contesting elections. But the implementation of this clause has not been strictly adhered to in the Indian elections. The opponents of this law have been firm on the opinion that a person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty by a court of law. It is paradoxical that everyone including the Election Commission knows that the ceiling of the expenditures fixed for elections is just enough to cover up the small proportion of actual expenses. There are no means by which the Election Commission could check the expenditure done by the candidates and political parties during the elections. During the election period, the State and Central Governments embark on the advertisement spree in the guise of providing information to the public. The expenditure incurred on these is recovered from public exchequer. This gives the government which is in power an edge over the others. The Union Government announced the Electoral Bonds Scheme in 2017-18 in Union Budget as part of certain electoral funding reforms. These bonds will prompt donors to take banking route to donate, with their identity captured by the issuing authority. The paid news and political advertisements have risen exponentially in the regional and national media. Election Commission has laid down a model that is Code of Conduct for the guidance of both the political parties and the candidates contesting elections. Some of these codes are since the announcement of elections, the ministers and other concerned authorities should not announce the financial grants in any form. Ministers, MPs and MLAS of the ruling party should not combine official visits with the electioneering work. The ministers and the other concerned officials shall not advance payments out of discretionary quotes after the announcement of elections. Criticism of other parties is to be kept confined to their policies, plans and their implementations etc. These set of norms have been evolved with the consensus of political parties who have consented to abide by the principles embodied in the said code in its letter and spirit. But the bitter truth is that these rules are openly flouted and never abided. The predicament is not the lack of laws, but their strict execution and implementation. Over the years, the Election Commission has conducted a number of laudable reforms to strengthen the democracy and conduct free and fair elections However, there is still a lot that can be done The Election Commission needs to be vested with more power and authority. It should have the power to penalise the politicians and political parties who disobey the electoral laws. The political parties need to show their will to abide by the reforms. It is high time that the citizens of India rise above the issues of religion, caste and community and vote on the basis of their convictions. The citizens must be aware of their rights and duties. An enlightened voter is the cornerstone of a successful democracy. All these reforms will go a long way towards making India a democracy in its true sense.",      
    "Topic44": "The 124th Constitutional Amendment was done to amend the constitution of India to extend 10 per cent reservation in direct recruitment in government jobs and for admission in higher educational institutions to 'economically weaker' sections. The reservation seeks to provide for the advancement of economically weaker sections of all castes and communities including Christians and Muslims. It intends to help the poor among the upper castes. In simple terms, reservation is about facilitating access to seats in the government jobs, educational institutions and even legislatures to certain sections of the population. In India, it is governed by government policies backed by the Indian Constitution. The origin of reservation system is rooted in the age-old caste system of India. These sections of society especially those of lower castes have faced historical injustice due to their caste identity. Historically, William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in 1882 originally conceived the idea of caste-based reservation system. The reservation system that exists today was introduced in 1933 when British Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald presented the 'Communal Award'. The award made provision for separate electorates for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and the Dalits. After long negotiations, Gandhi and Ambedkar signed the Poona Pact', where it was decided that there would be a single Hindu electorate with certain reservations in it. After independence, initially reservations were provided only for SCs and STs. OBCs were included in the ambit of reservation in 1991 on the recommendations of the Mandal Commission. The increase in demand for reservation can be traced to the fact that it is being seen as a remedy for the adverse effects of ill-thought out development policies. A number of factors are responsible for violent agitation associated with demands for reservation. These are acute agrarian distress, increase in unemployment and loss of jobs among many others. A widespread demand for reservations among different sections of society is being made; this includes Marathas in Maharashtra, Jats in Haryana, Rajputs in Rajasthan, Kapus in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and Patel Patidars in Gujarat among many others. Increasing reservation demands among upper castes are also arising from the fear of losing privilege and the inability to cope with change. Thus, upper castes have begun to feel disadvantaged especially in context of government jobs as they don't get similar advantages like the backward classes. In a significant move to address demands of the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society who were earlier not covered by any of the existing schemes of reservation. The 124th Amendment to the Constitution, 2019 was brought so as to provide 10 per cent reservation for the weaker section of general category in direct recruitment for government jobs and admission to higher educational institutions. The Act amends Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, by adding a clause which allows state to make special provision for the advancement of any economically weaker sections of general category. Accordingly Articles 15(6) and 16(6) have been inserted in the Constitution to effect the reservation for EWS. The Union Government has set certain criterion to be eligible for reservation in EWS category. The reservation benefits can be availed by those persons who are not covered under the scheme of reservation for SCs, STS and OBCs and whose family has gross annual income below 8 lakh. Income shall also include income from all sources i.e. salary, agriculture, business, profession, etc., for the financial year prior to the year of application. Also, persons whose family owns or possesses any of the following assets shall be excluded from being identified as EWS, irrespective of the family income 5 acres of agricultural land and above, Residential flat of 1000 sqft. and above. Residential plot of 100 sq. yards and above in notified municipalities. Residential plot of 200 sq. yards and above in areas other than the notified municipalities. The property held by a 'Family' in different locations or different places/cities would be clubbed while applying the land or property holding test to determine EWS status. The term 'Family' for this purpose will include the person who seeks benefit of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years as also his/her spouse and children below the age of 18 years. Further, the states will also determine the reservation criterion accordingly depending upon local factors. The applicability of the reservation is for both jobs in the government sector as well as for seats in higher educational institutions i.e. colleges and universities. As the Constitution stands amended, the only constitutional challenge left is conformity to the basic structure doctrine. So far, it has become an established principle that reservation shall have a cap of 50%. In the Indira Sawhney Case (1992), the Supreme Court said that such quotas cannot be provided for poverty alone. It has to be poverty plus social and educational backwardness and the backwardness should reflect historic injustice through generations. The court then said that reservations beyond 50% will hit Article 14 (Right to Equality). Half of jobs and seats in educational institutions must, therefore be for the general merit category. Equality is part of the basic structure, the court insisted. Hence, this step will also violate the Supreme Court ruling of Kesavananda Bharati Case which said that any amendment which offended the basic structure of Constitution would be ultra vires. Reservation is fair, as far as it provides appropriate positive discrimination for the benefit of the downtrodden and economically backward sections of the society. Hovever, it also leads to associated problems, such as passing the benefits to only a privileged group who have already been benefited by reservation. The communities excluded from reservations often harbour animosity and prejudice against the castes included in the reservation category. When more people aspire for backwardness rather than of forwardness, the country itself stagnates. A strong political will is indispensable to find equilibrium between justice to the backwards, equity for the forwards and efficiency for the entire system.",      
    "Topic45": "The reservation for women in Indian Parliament is an attempt to acknowledge the internal complexities within the category of women by recognising their respective deprivation points derived from social inequalities. The 17th Lok Sabha that has been elected in 2019 has witnessed the highest number of women ever in the Parliament with 78 women MP's (Member of Parliament) elected from all over the country. Women's representation in the Lok Sabha has increased from 113 percent in 2014 to 14 percent in 2019, coming across as a positive development. Women's Reservation Bill was first presented in 2008 by the UPA Government as the 108th Constitutional Amendment Bill. The Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha in 2010 However, the introduction was also attempted previously in 1996 but it failed to we the light of day in any house. In the last two decades, various efforts have been pot by the different governments. But the effort, to our dismay, has met a dead end. Reservation for any group is an 'affirmative action' by the state to promote or empower or emancipate the group. As in almost every case, these groups have faced subjugation in the past due to systematic or social discrimination. In this context, when the 73rd Constitutional Amendment was passed in India, providing for grassroot democracy at the Panchayat level, 33% seats were reserved for women. This provision has substantially changed the face of villages in our country. Women getting elected as a leader have become an agent of change and have contributed towards the well-being of other women too. In the Indian Parliament, Women's Reservation Bill (108th Amendment) was introduced with the aim to provide 33% reservation for women in Parliament and State Assemblies. The Bill also has a provision where one third seats will be reserved for women from the seats reserved for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe in Parliament and State Assembly. Reservation of seats in the constituency will be allotted by rotation in Parliament and State Assembly. An authority will be appointed by Parliament which will determine the allocation of reserved seats. Also the Bill highlights that the provision will cease to exist after 15 years from the commencement of the Act. The Bill was passed in the State Assembly in 2010 but remained pending in Lok Sabha due to which it has finally lapsed in Parliament. India was ranked low at 112th position out of 153 countries in Global Gender Gap Index 2020. Apart from this, there is widening of its gender gaps in political empowerment as well as in life expectancy and basic literacy. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women released a world ranking of the number of women parliamentarians, in which India is ranked 148th among 193 countries. Looking at the data released, IPU Secretary-General Martin Chungong backed up the call for reservation of women in governing bodies which could speed up the process for achieving gender equality. Another reason why women should be given reservations in Parliament and State Assembly is because the female parliamentarians and State Legislators will be more sensitive to the issues plaguing the lives of women. Indian society is mostly a patriarchal society. Crime against women in the form of rape, dowry, domestic violence, systematic marginalisation, female foeticide etc. is rampant across the length and breadth of the country. Therefore, to attain gender parity and reduce crimes against women, women themselves have to act as an agent of change. When women representation increases in the Parliament, it will indirectly or directly also facilitate the other related goals. It will create environment for positive social and economic policies for realisation of full potential of women. It will lead to de-jure and de-facto enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedom. It will facilitate equal access of females to health, education, employment, social security, etc. It will change the societal attitude and community practices which block freedom and empowerment of women. There is furious opposition against the Bill. Some consider it as a step backward and a move in the wrong direction. They suggest that there will be pseudo representation. It has been observed at the Panchayat level that the seats which get reserved for women are filled by a candidate who is either wife or a female relative of the male representative. In reality, when these female candidates are elected, their male counterparts run a puppet show. Therefore, there is no actual empowerment. Also it is argued that reservation will stifle choice for voters, leaving the meritorious candidates behind. As a result, it will create a wider chasm and gender inequality will further perpetuate. Resentment will flow among male candidates and as a result of this, women will be further marginalised. Political commentators are of the view that the provision may not guarantee a tickle down effect where its benefit reaches the lowest strata of the society. The politically, economically and socially affluent women will grab the seats thereby bringing no change and maintaining status quo. Women Reservation Bill has been pending for a very long period of time. But before the Bill get passed by the Parliament, groundwork needs to be done for real result. Otherwise, it will meet fate where marginalised will remain marginalised and power will accrue in the affluent. Thus, it is concluded that the Women's Reservation Bill will indeed be a milestone towards achieving the goal of a true and enlightened democracy and must be enacted at the earliest possible opportunity.",      
    "Topic46": "Indian democracy was born on 26th January, 1950 when the Constitution of India came into effect. The people of India chose Parliamentary democracy, on the British parliamentary model to constitute a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic and republic state through the adoption of Constitution that became a model for all those who were striving to build a humane, just and egalitarian society based on equality. In a representative democracy such as India people surrender their rights to an elected body chosen through periodic elections. They allow their representatives to make laws and policies affecting their interests. The representatives are known as MPs or MLAs or counsillors. They represent the people of the constituencies from which they have been duly elected. Through representation, people indirectly participate in the functioning the government. If the representatives are unable to act responsible, it results in injustice against the people. Democratic principles envisage that a person who seeks to be a representative should take responsibility. Thus, the representatives of people in a democracy should have a good moral character, should be empathetic and be mindful of the interests of the people of his constituency. In today's politics, the trust of the electorate is repeatedly violated, morality has become a myth and politicians have become over concerned with capturing power. The degradation of political culture is due to the loss of responsible character among our representatives. This has called for our representatives to be more informed and educated. Demands have been put to make educational qualifications necessary for contesting elections to be representatives of the people. But this recommendation requires a thorough discussion of the advantages as well as disadvantages of this step. In India, for contesting elections, there are currently no educational qualifications, only simple qualifications are required to represent any Constituency. These include a person should be resident citizen of the country. The person should be atleast 25 years of age. The person should be registered as a voter in any Constituency. He/she should not be convicted of any offence and sentenced to an imprisonment of 2 years or more. He/she should not hold any office of profit. Thus, no educational qualifications have been prescribed for contesting elections and representing the constituency. This is because it is argued that the most relevant qualifications for a MP or MLA are the ability to understand the people's concerns and represent their interests. If they are more educated but fail to represent the interests of the voters adequately, they will be voted out of power whereas if a candidate is not highly educated but keeps the interest of his electorate supreme, then there is not a better representative than him/her. When the issue of necessary educational qualifications came up before Constituent Assembly, it was decided that educational qualifications should not be made mandatory for contesting elections for the politicians as large number of freedom fighters dropped out of their school and college education to serve national cause. Also, most of the Indian electorate were illiterate which would have deprived them from representing the nation. So, it was decided that political sense and capability and social awareness in an individual should be the most decisive factors in allowing a person to represent the interests of the fellow citizen. Education is the most important aspect in the present world for an individual. Our representatives are our leaders. People look upon at their representatives as guide who can properly work for their interests. Thus, educational qualifications are also necessary for politicians seeking to contest elections. Following arguments, can be given in support of educational qualifications for our representatives It would enhance the policy-making quality in India as better educated and specialised politicians will be able to better understand the needs and aspirations of the people. They would be in a better state to understand and predict the policy measures required to get rid of the current and future problems of Indian population. Less qualified politicians will not be able to cope up with the global changes and will not be able to understand diplomatic situations with other countries of the world as well as world leaders. It would attract some of the most brilliant minds from the country for contesting elections because they will perceive the election battle ground to be familiar and welcoming when they will see politicians with qualifications similar to theirs. Educational qualifications would also raise the general level of education in the country. More people would become inspired to get literate and educated if the political leaders will start to do so. Currently, most of them are non-specialised. They work for the general welfare of the people. The task of specialised activities is left to the civil servants and committees who are allowed to frame more specific rules and regulations. Educated politicians will be able to better understand the administration and specialised tasks which are currently delegated to the bureaucracy. The great Greek philosopher Aristotle had said that the educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living differs from the dead. Thus, education is seen as providing an advantage to an individual if he wants to serve the people of his/her country. Currently, in politics, winning elections has become the primary motive of the politicians. The candidate's winnability and economic wealth is considered as decisive factors in deciding whether the candidate will be able to serve the interests of his/her constituency or not. If education is prescribed as criteria for contesting election, it would reduce the influence of these factors in politics. Though there has been a favourable wave towards prescribing minimum educational qualifications for politicians, yet there are various aspects of the disadvantages of this move, which cannot be ignored. These are - Education is one of the fundamental rights of every citizen in the country. Providing education to each and every citizen is the duty of the state. Thus, it is the state that has failed to provide education, and for failure of the state citizens cannot be punished. They cannot be deprived of their right to contest elections because of the failure of state. Educational qualifications have not been prescribed under the Constitution, expect for a very few posts that involve specialisation. Thus, the Constitution makers did not envision any educational qualifications for any posts except for a few. It is believed that more than education, character and commitment for politicians are important. A strong and well-built character will be effectively able to represent the interests of the people who have voted them to power. Correct and just use of power does not require any educational qualifications but a good moral character and ethical behaviour is required. As most of the people in India are still illiterate, prescribing minimum educational qualifications will deprive majority of the common people from contesting elections. Thus, if majority of the people will get disqualified from contesting elections, it will result in inequality of opportunity in contesting elections that is against the constitutional principles of equality before law. Prescribing minimum disqualifications would deprive a large number of females from contesting elections as it is the females that drop out of schools and colleges to take care of the household chores and family. Thus, minimum educational qualifications for politicians may be required but it must address the existing concerns that come in the way of democratic rights of the illiterate and poor citizens of India who will be affected the most if such educational classifications are made mandatory. The largest concern is that if educational qualifications are made mandatory then majority of the existing legislators will also become ineligible to contest elections. It is not doubtful that certain minimum educational qualifications are necessary for politicians so that the best of minds should govern our country. Yet it cannot be enforced upon the country with the blink of an eye. The minimum educational qualifications that should be prescribed shall be left to the wisdom of the common people and the politicians. Simultaneously, various other reforms can be initiated to clean the political system of the country and ensure that people with good moral character having good education enter politics. These reforms and suggestive measures are political parties should reform their structure of election of members to the party. If men who are highly educated having ethical and moral principles enter into politics, it would lead to the betterment of existing political system. Criminalisation and money and muscle power should be reduced in the elections. More awareness should be spread among the electors so that they themselves choose candidates that are educated and not the ones having criminal background. Role of money can be reduced by putting limits on the election expenditure and strictly implementing the code of conduct. Spending in education, health and similar social services should be raised so that general level of education can be raised. This will automatically improve the elected representatives in the longer term because more educated people will join politics. Student politics should be strengthened and more students should be encouraged to participate in the public political life. More number of university students coming into politics will challenge the existing political system and the elected as well as unelected leaders will try to reflect upon their own capabilities. Thus, a well-informed individual, having a powerful will and strongest moral character represents the interests of the people most effectively. Though educational qualifications are required for politicians yet they are not necessary. Education helps in decision-making and without education it can be difficult for politicians to solve the problems of society. So, if more educated citizens with good moral character enter the politics, they can be better leaders who would work for the interests of people that they represent.",

India's Progress Towards e-governance India started its own e-Governance initiative with the establishment of National Informatics Centre (NIC) in 1977. But the main thrust for e-Governance was provided by the launching of NICNET (National Informatics Centre Network) in 1987 which was the national satellite-based computer network. This was followed by the launch of the District Information System of the National Informatics Centre (DISNIC) programme to computerise all district offices in the country for which free hardware and software was offered to State Governments NICNET was extended via the state capitals to all district headquarters by 1990. A large number of e-Governance initiatives were taken at the union and state levels. In 1999, the Union Ministry of Information Technology was created.

The goal of Government-to-Customer (G2C) e-Governance is to offer a variety of ICT services to citizens in an efficient and economical manner, and to strengthen the relationship between government and citizens using technology. Under G2C, various projects viz Bhoomi project by Karnataka Government, Lokvani project by Uttar Pradesh Government, E-Mitra by Rajasthan Government, E-Seva by Andhra Pradesh Government, Gyandoot by Madhya Pradesh Government, UMANG App by the Union Government have been launched. Government-to-Business (G2B) is the online non-commercial interaction between local and Central Government and the commercial business sector with the purpose of providing business information and advice G2B refers to the conduction through the internet between government agencies and trading companies. Under the projects like E-Procurement of Andhra Pradesh Government, MCA-21 implemented by Ministry of Corporate Affairs was launched. Government-to-Government (G2G) is the electronic sharing of data and/or information systems between government agencies, departments or organisations. The goal of G2G is to support e-government initiatives by improving communication, data access and data sharing. Some successful G2G projects are North-East Gang Information System (NEGIS), Khajane of Karnataka Government, and Smart Government of Andhra Pradesh. Apart from these, Central Government introduced Mission Mode Projects (MMPs). A Mission Mode Project is an individual project within the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), that focuses on one aspect of electronic governance, such as banking. Land records or commercial taxes, etc. With NeGP, 'mission mode' implies that projects have clearly defined objectives, scopes and implementation of timelines and milestone, as well as measurable outcomes and service levels. NeGP comprises 31 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) which are further classified as Central, State and MMPs. Central MMPs include Banking, Central Excise and Customs, Income Tax (IT), Insurance, MCA 21, Passport, Immigration, Visa and Foreigners Registration and Tracking, Pension, E-office, Posts, VID. State MMPs include Agriculture, Commercial Taxes, E-District, Employment Exchange, Land Records Management Programme (NLRMP), Municipalities, E-Panchayats, Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS), Road Transport, Treasuries Computerisation, PDS, Education and Health Integrated MMPs include CSC, e-Biz, e-courts, e-Procurement, EDI for e-Trade, National e-Governance Service Delivery Gatesway, India Portal etc. Some of the recent initiatives taken by the Government of India in the field of e-Governance in the country includes the Arogya Setu application was launched in April, 2020 by the Union Government to map the spread of Covid-19 infection. Apart from contact tracing, Arogya Setu application was used for providing citizen services such as e-pass for travel and entry into a number of facilities such as metros and airports. TRACKPDS was developed by the state of Haryana to capture food grains request during the Covid-19 lockdown period from the distressed residents. It was integrated with state helplines, district headquarters and unorganised labour portals. It also provides facility to manage the beneficiaries on 22nd June, 2020, Jammu and Kashmir Governor launched e-Application-cum-Issuance of Domicile Certificate developed by JakeGA. It is meant to speed up public delivery mechanism through minimum human intervention, besides ensuring efficiency, transparency and reliability of such services. BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) mobile app launched in 2016 to facilitate e-payments directly through banks. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) allowing online interoperable financial inclusion transaction through the business correspondent of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication. Digital India Programme aiming to transform the country into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. Direct cash transfer to facilitate disbursements of government entitlements like MGNREGA, social security pension, etc. of any Central or State Government bodies, using Aadhaar as supported by UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India). e-Kranti scheme for linking the internet with remote villages in the country launched in 2014. Survey of India has launched a new web portal called Naksbe to make open series of maps available to Indians for free. These maps are meant for development activities in the country and can also be used to plan scientific expeditions, research etc. Some states viz, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have implemented e-Government modules in Panchayat, MMPs for e-Governance in Municipalities is implemented under Phase I of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and applicable to 65 Mission cities. The government has to publish all the information online through websites. This can be facilitated through centralised storage of information, localisation of content and content management. The information of government is public information, therefore the citizens are entitled to know every piece of information of the government, because the government is of the people, by the people and for the people. Despite its advantages, e-Governance faces many challenges in various ways. Universal access to the internet is still far away in India. India has a wide digital divide between rural and urban India, thus, the reach of e-Governance initiative is very limited. Lack of proper infrastructure particularly in rural areas, restricts the people from reaping the benefits of e-Governance. Illiteracy of the users and their lack of ability to use computers is also a great impediment. Other hindrances include public concern over the cyber security, not providing e-mail address due to the fear of spam and government retention of transaction or interaction history, etc. States like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kerala are ahead in e-Governance, but others like Bihar, Jharkhand and North-East are lagging behind.",      
    "Topic48": "Fundamental rights are defined as those rights which are essential for intellectual, moral and spiritual development of individuals. All these rights are essential for existence of individuals, hence called Fundamental rights. These are universally applicable to all citizens, irrespective of race, birth place, religion, caste or gender. The origin of Fundamental rights can be traced to England's Magna Carta, the United States' Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The Part III of the Constitution of India gives a detailed description on a charter of rights called the Fundamental Rights. It is described as the Magna Carta of India. These Fundamental Rights guarantee civil freedom to all the citizens of India to allow them to live in peace and harmony. These are the basic rights available to every Indian citizen irrespective of their caste, creed and religion, place of birth, race, colour or gender. These Fundamental Rights include Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Right to Freedom of Religion, Cultural and Educational Rights, Right against Exploitation. The Fundamental Rights were included in the Constitution because they were considered essential for the development of every individual and to preserve human dignity. They are justiciable i.e. any violation of these rights can be questioned in the court of law (the Supreme Court and High Court) through writs Changes in Fundamental Rights require a constitutional amendment. The Constitution originally laid seven rights including the Right to Property, but the 44th Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property, though it still is a constitutional right. Long after the deletion of the Right to Property, Right to Education was added to the list of Fundamental Rights under Section 21A on 2nd April, 2010. The concept of Fundamental Rights limits the power of government and the executive and the legislature from becoming authoritative or dictatorial. It all provides an opportunity for the individual for self-development. Constitutions did not contain such provisions have resulted into dictatorial rule. Hence, the philosophy and concept, underlying the Fundamental Rights is that constitution limitation on the power of the government is the only way of ensuring and safe-guarding the basic human freedoms and so the dignity and self-respect for the individuals. The Fundamental Rights have been listed under seven sections from Articles 12 to 35, which include Right to Equality guarantees to all persons (citizens as well as other) equal before the law and equal protection of law. It prohibits discrimination between citizens on ground of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of the all citizens have equal access to shops, public entertainments and places of public resort, which are maintained wholly or partly by the state. However, special provisions may be made in respect of women, children, socially and educationally backward classes and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The Constitution guarantees equal opportunities relating to public employment to all citizens, but some posts may be reserved for backward classes. It abolishes untouchability and also abolishes the system of conferring titles by the state, except military and academic distinctions. Right to Freedom includes a variety of rights such as right to speech and expression, right to assemble peacefully or to form association, right to more freely throughout the territory of India, right to life and liberty, right to reside and settle in any part of India and so on. Right against Exploitation ensures that seeks to ban trafficking in human beings, beggar or any other form of forced labour. Employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory or mine or other risky occupations is also prohibited by law. Right to Freedom of Religion ensures that all citizens have been guaranteed freedom to profess, practice and propagate any religion. Every religious group has been given the freedom to manage its religious affairs and to own, acquire and administer property for religious or charitable purposes. Cultural and Educational Rights guarantees to the minorities the right of conserving their language, script and culture, to receive education and administer educational institutions of their choice. Right to Constitutional Remedies guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. This right can, however, suspended during the operation of a proclamation of emergency by the President. There are certain Fundamental Rights which are granted only to citizens of India and not to foreigners. These include protection from discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (Article 15), equality of opportunity matters of public employment (Article 16), freedom of speech and expression (Article 19), Protection of language, script and culture of minorities (Article 29 and cultural and educational (Article 30). It is important to note that the Fundamental Rights given in Article 12-35 of the Indian Constitution cannot be violated. In case of its violation, it can be questioned in a court of law through certain writs under Article 32. These writs include Habeas Corpus. It is a command of the court to a person who is detaining another person, to bring the body of the person in his custody at a stipulated time and place for a specified purpose. Mandamus - It is an order that commands a person or a body to do what constitutes his or its duty as legal performance. It is issued to prevent a subordinate court not to exceed its jurisdiction or act contrary to the norms of natural justice. Certiorari It is used to order the shifting of a suit from a lower court to higher court to prevent an excess or abuse of jurisdiction before the commencement of the trial. Quo Warranto It restrains a person from acting in an office to which he is not entitled. The court may declare the office vacant. Ever since its adoption, the chapter on Fundamental Rights in the Constitution has been under criticism, both in India and outside. The critics argued that some important rights such as Right to Work etc. were not included. It was also pointed out that the spirit of the whole chapter was spoiled by taking away much of the freedoms or rights provided through the insertion of many preventive provisions such as preventive detention, suspension of the right to constitutional remedies etc. In 2017, the nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court headed by former Chief Justice of India JS Khehar in a landmark unanimous decision has declared Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21. Another landmark judgement with regard to the protection of Fundamental Right is the passing of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriages) Bill 2017 by Lok Sabha which declares Triple Talaq illegal and criminalises it with up to three years of imprisonment for husband. The majority of judges found Triple Talaq violative of the Constitution and Fundamental Right under Article 14 (Equality before Law). The success or failure of a democracy depends largely on the extent to which civil liberties and basic rights are enjoyed by the citizens. A democracy must aim at the highest development of the individual, which can certainly be achieved through the Fundamental Rights Only a free society wherein individuals feel dignified, enjoy basic rights can assure the all-round and quick progress of its members and thus of the nation itself. Herein lies the importance of Fundamental Rights in the success of democracy.",      
    "Topic49": "Fundamental rights are enshrined in Part III of Indian Constitution from Article 12 to 35. Fundamental Rights in Part III is rightly described as the Magna Carta of India. The fundamental rights are aimed to promote ideal of political democracy in India. They prevent the establishment of an authoritarian and despotic rule in country and to protect the rights and liberties of people against the invasion by states. The fundamental rights are guaranteed to all persons without any discrimination. They uphold the equality and dignity of individuals, the larger public interest and unity of nation. Internet being an ocean of information helps in developing informed citizens. An informed citizen is more aware of its fundamental rights. They help in keeping the excesses of the Government in check, thus, preventing the establishment of a despotic rule in the country. With the Right to Freedom that guarantees the Freedom of Speech and Expression as fundamental right, there has also been demand to declare Right to Internet as a fundamental right in view that people must have access to internet while exercising their Rights of Freedom and Speech. It is time that we recognise the Right to Internet access as a fundamental right. Internet broadband and mobile internet services are a lifeline to people in India from all walks of life. While the internet is certainly a main source of information and communication, it is so much more than that and people working in the technology based economy like the thousands of delivery workers for Swiggy, Amazon etc, and the cab drivers of Uber and Ola depend on the internet for their livelihoods. It is a mode of access to education for students who do courses and take exams online. Access to the internet is important to facilitate the promotion and enjoyment of the Right to Education. The internet provides access to transport for millions of urban and rural people, it is also a mode to access to health services online. More than anything, it is a means for business and occupation for thousands of small and individual owned enterprises which sell their products and services online. Thus, the access to the internet is a right that is very similar to what Supreme Court held with respect to the right to privacy in the Justice KS Puttaswamy judgement, a right that is located through all our fundamental rights and freedoms. These include the Right to freedom of speech and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association freedom of trade and occupation and the Right to life, education, health, livelihood, dignity and privacy under Article 21. Karla High Court in Faheema Shirin w State of Kerala (2019) declared the Right to internet acess as a fundamental right forming a part of the Right to Privacy and the Right to Education under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. In present digital world where almost every service is being digitised, it is important to recognise the Right to Internet access as an independent right. Court observed that the internet acts as a learning tool and nobody can impose restrictions on it, citing discipline. Human Rights Council of the United Nations also regards the Right of access to the Internet as a fundamental freedom and a tool to ensure the Right to education. Also, the Supreme Court has declared that access to the internet is protected under Article 19 of the Constitution. In response to a plea again the pension of internet services in Jammu and Kashmir since last August, the court firmed that the Right to freedom of speech and expression, as guaranteed to all citizens under the first section of that article, covers the right to go online, In effect, even if left unsaid, this would make internet access a fundamental right. Though, the recognition of such a fundamental right is laudable, it does have reasonable restrictions' under specified circumstances. The judgement gave administration space to restrict internet access on the condition that it's proportionate to the problem identified. This formulation seems furry and could provide enough scope for administration to justify internet snap-offs in various cases. Further, a digital divide in the economy would render a sizeable proportion of the population unable to enjoy the fundamental right to Internet. This will eventually lead furthering of social disparities. Moreover, the rising number of cyber related crimes would leave more people susceptible in absence of proper guidelines related to the Right to Internet access. Internet itself is a great force which has shackled the monotony and global order by its brute force. Anything which has power can be used in both good and bad ways. As we know internet can be a boon and bane at same time. It rests with the people after recognising internet as fundamental right how to utilise the power that comes with internet. Both good and bad powers have large implication the lives of people. As both Supreme and High Courts through various elements in country have to strike balance between rights of individuals and right of state, preservation of balance should be of utmost importance to enable individual to become a balanced and responsible citizen. The Right to Internet access and digital literacy will empower citizens with increased access to information, services and the creation of better livelihood opportunities. ",      
    "Topic50": "Panchayati Raj was a pious dream of our great leader Mahatma Gandhi who wanted to strengthen the democracy at the grassroots level by this system. In our country, 70 per cent of the population is in rural areas and the panchayats have been the backbone of the Indian villages since independence. Panchayati raj refers to the system of rural local self-government in India. The history of Panchayati Raj goes back since the days of our independence Efforts were made to strengthen the system of Panchayati Raj in order to give citizens a sense of participation in the nation building programme. It was in pursuance of this objective that community development programme was launched in 1952. It was an effort to provide and encourage development and employment in rural areas, use of scientific methods of agriculture, encourage cotton and small scale industries among other things. Different Committees Reports Regarding Panchayati Raj. To evaluate the effects of community development programme Balwant Rai Mehta Committee was set up in 1953 that suggested setting up of Panchayati Raj Institutions. The underlying idea was to usher in an era of 'Democratic Decentralisation. Few other committees that were formed on Panchayati Raj were: VT Krishnamachari, 1960, Ashok Mehta Committee, 1977: GVK Rao Committee, 1985; LM Singhvi Committee, 1986. Finally, in 1993 through 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, Panchayati Raj Institutions were established. The Constitution provides for a three tier structure of Panchayati Raj. The District Panchayat or Zila Parishad at District level, a Block Panchayat at the intermediate level and a Gram Panchayat at the village level. In most of the states, members of Gram Panchayat constitute a body called Gram Sabha and all the voters of this constituency are members of this body. Gram Sabha is not a tier of the system. It doesn't have any executive function and operates only as a recommending body. Almost all the states have delegated powers and responsibilities in varying degrees to the panchayats. Article 243G of the Constitution has broadly outlined areas of functions for preparing plans for socio-economic development of their areas. These areas are explicitly highlighted in the 11th Schedule of the Constitution. The functions highlighted are ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining community assets, health and sanitation, rural electrification, physical infrastructure viz roads, bridges, waterways etc. There are many changes that these institutions have brought about. Under Articles 40 and 246 (3), the Constitution grants powers to the states to make laws to enable the functioning of the self-government units. Haryana and Rajasthan are the states who mandate to fix minimum education qualification for those contesting in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI's). In August 2015, the Bihar Assembly also passed amendments making it mandatory for candidates contesting Panchayat Polls to have toilets in their homes. Through Gram Panchayats, activities in MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) are handed out and auditing of work is done. MGNREGS has brought a sigh of relief for rural populace as rural distress was brewing due to unemployment. MGNREGS has become a cog in the wheel of growth and development. Gram Sabha acts as a pivotal body that is involved in building infrastructure and providing employment to people in rural areas. Many State and Central Government schemes have been implemented at the grassroot level by these bodies. Schemes of rural housing (Pradhan Mantri Awas Youna), rural electrification (Gramin Vidyut Abhiyantas), health and sanitation (ICDS and Swachh Bharat Mission), physical infrastructure (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana) etc, have made conspicuous difference in rural areas. These schemes have been implemented with the assistance of the Panchayati Raj Institutions Similarly, Gram Panchayats have worked as the first response entity during the times of disaster. Mock drills, awareness programme have enabled these bodies to respond quickly during the needful times. Panchayati Raj Institutions have broken the caste, age and gender structures of village. No higher caste people, old members and males are at the helm of decision-making. The provision of 33% reservation for women and provision for reservation for SC/ST in the body has enabled villagers and the government to achieve parity in the village. This has broken the age old structures and has mainstreamed the marginalised. Among the states that already follow 50% reservation for women in Panchayati Raj are Bihar, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra. The reservation of seats for women, Scheduled Castes and Tribes in Panchayats is a welcome step, for it would make the institution of Panchayat more democratic, representative and balanced. Similarly, in the field of agriculture, these bodies have contributed enormously Awareness about organic farming, soil health card scheme has been implemented with the help of Gram Sabha Similarly, many infrastructure projects, animal husbandry activities, fisheries etc., have been carried out by these bodies Cooperatives like AMUL were conceived at these levels. Therefore, pooling of resources and efforts have been their hallmark. Similarly, concepts of social forestry, agroforestry have been encouraged by panchayats. The government has planned to set up formal markets which would remove the intermediaries. So, that the maximum share of profit lands in the hands of farmers Panchayats will be an enabling factor in this scheme. Also, panchayats have mandate to make plans and implement them in the areas of small scale industries, food processing industries, khadi and cottage industries. These industries require proper planning and financing with coordination among Central, State and Panchayat level bodies it will help in realising the full potential Challenges Faced by Panchayati Raj institutions. Panchayati Raj in India has not been an absolute success. Its functioning all these years has demonstrated numerous shortcomings. These include (i) the inadequacy of funds has stood in the way of successful working of the Panchayati Raj Institutions. (ii) The tendency on the part of the higher structure to treat the lower structure as its subordinate is markedly visible (iii) Participation of the people hardly happens in reality since the key administrative and technical positions are manned by the government officials (iv) The performance of Panchayati Raj Institutions has been vitiated by political cum caste factionalism, rendering developmental projects into chimeras. (v) These bodies also experience several administrative problems like politicisation of local administration, lack of coordination between the popular and bureaucratic elements etc. These structural and functional issues, which have created impediment in realising the full potential, need to be dealt with strong hand. Panchayati Raj Institutions have enormous potential to transform the face of the rural India. But, there are some structural and functional issues which have created impediments in realising the full potential. Thus, the Panchayat System in India assumes very significant role. This system is quite rational, practicable and in perfect harmony with the spirit of democracy and should be further strengthened and encouraged. It should be made economically viable and self-sufficient by providing adequate resources, funds and generous grants.",      
    "Topic51": "Ethics can be defined as the moral principles that govern a person's behaviour for the conducting of an activity. Morals are the normally acceptable standards and principles of the right and the wrong. The public servants are the government's employees who are working for the welfare of the people of the country. The public servants are expected to adhere to ethical norms and values while fulfilling their duties. Although the government and our law lay down the guidelines and regulatory criteria for them, these cannot be imposed on an individual. These have to be guided by one's own conscience which comes from within. The Constitution expects the civil servants to be fair and transparent in their public dealings. They need to act without any prejudices while implementing the policies of the state. All the citizens of the country should be equal in their eyes irrespective of their social stature. It is important for them to reflect, understand their roles and responsibilities and align them with their ethics and morals. The public servants are the guardians of the sensitive and confidential information of the people and government. It is their duty to keep it safe and not disclose it until it is important and unavoidable. A public servant needs to display exemplary courage to stand for something which is morally correct. This may invite strong protests and opposition from the different dominating sections of the society but they need to stay strong and committed towards their duties. The role and duty of a public servant is under a constant scrutiny from the people and government. A public servant has the power to take the decisions which have direct impact on the lives of the people. While taking the decisions, they need to keep the benefits of a larger section of the society in mind. The personal biases and choices must be kept separate from the welfare of the people and the decisions must be taken rationally. With the changing times, the role of public servants has evolved. Their roles have important become significant in the socio-economic development of the country. They have an important role in maintaining India's democratic set up and at the same time nurturing the economic and social well-being of the people and the country. The government has appointed the public servants for the welfare of people In fact, the people of the society also look up to them for the same. They are an important part of the nation building activities. There are numerous young people who are aspiring to join the public service department. The public service department is known by the group of people who are working for it. The reputation and success of the governance depends upon the conduct of the public servants and public's perception about them. Thus, it becomes important for them to be fair and just in their public dealings. Their personal interests need to take a backseat in front of the interests of the masses. In the past few years, the issues of corruption and nepotism have dominated the system. The practice of nepotism involves the appointment of relatives, friends and acquaintances to the public service department; irrespective of their merit and credibility. This is weakening the roots of the system as the people tend to lose their faith in the bureaucracy. The impact of the actions of the servants on the masses is so significant that the people have adopted the same ideology. They are resorting to unfair means to get their work done. The people are ready to bribe the persons in order to get the right work done at the right time. This is how the vicious cycle of corruption has entered our system. Service, Value and Integrity of Public Servants Strong morals and ethics protect the individuals from becoming vulnerable and falling prey to greed and desires. They are the guiding light of the individual in the dark times. It is true that bending the rules and principles will pave way for quick professional success. But the actual professional success of a public servant is measured on the basis of his services, values and integrity. Ethics in public service is not just an idea, but also an imperative and mandatory practice. Citizens depend on public servants to be professional, honest and most importantly ethical. The public officials and departments form the cornerstone of the development of a country. It is high time that they value the power and position conferred to them. They need to use these constructively to make our country a truly developed economy.",      
    "Topic52": "The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is an official record of all the legal citizens of India. So far, Assam is the only state with such a document. It governed by the Citizenship Act 1955 and die Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 (amended in 2009) and 2010 order of the Ministry of Home Affairs, published in the Gazette of India. It will include persons whose names appear in any of the electoral rolls upto the midnight of 24th March, 1971 or National Register of Citizens, 1951 and their descendants. The NRC preparation was the biggest exercise in India carried out under the supervision of the Supreme Court to identify illegal immigrants, as well as their descendants, settled illegally in state of Assam. The NRC is different from a census as the census is conducted every decade on a national level and gives the state a window into the size and nature of Indian population. There is no obligation with the citizens to prove their citizenship claims and rights in a census. However, the NRC is a unique exercise, in which onus to prove citizenship lies with the citizens. They have to, through documentary evidence, show bow they have come to be citizens of India living in Assam. The NRC has its roots in the Memorandum of Settlement or the Assam Accord signed between the Assam State Students Union and the Government of India in 1985. The Assam Accord was a Memorandum of Settlement signed between representatives of the Government of India and the leaders of the Assam Movement in New Delhi on 15th August, 1985 The accord was an outcome of the violent anti-migrant movement from 1979-85 It contained provisions that all foreigners' who came to Assam after 25th March, 1971 should be detected and deported under the Illegal Migration (Determination by Tribunals) Act (IMDT). 1983 Those Bangladeshis who came between 1966 and 1971 had to be barred from voting for ten years and the international borders would be sealed and all persons who crossed over from Bangladesh after 1971 were to be deported. The process of NRC update was taken up in Assam as per a Supreme Court order in 2013. In order to stop cases of illegal migration from Bangladesh and other adjoining areas, NRC updation was carried out under The Citizenship Act, 1935 and according to rules framed in the Assam Accord The Citizenship Act of 1955 was amended after the Assam Accord for all Indian-origin people who came from Bangladesh before 1st January, 1966 to be deemed as citizens. Those who came between 1st January, 1966 and 25th March, 1971 were eligible for citizenship after registering and living in the state for 10 years while those entering after 25th March, 1971 were to be deported. In 2014, the Supreme Court asked the state government to update the 1951 NRC in a time-bound manner. Present exercise has been conducted under the supervision of the Supreme Court. The verification process involved house-to-house field verification, determination of authenticity of documents, family tree investigations in order to rule out any false claim of parenthood and separate hearings for married women. Existence of name in the legacy data which is the collective list of the NRC data of 1951 and the electoral rolls upto midnight of 24th March, 1971 and proving linkage with the person whose name appears in the legacy data serve as a citizenship proof for the exercise. The excluded people had about 120 days to appeal against their exclusion to the foreigner tribunals. To speed up the process 200 new tribunals had been made functional in addition to the already existing. If they are not satisfied with the tribunals, people can also move to High Court and the Supreme Court for redressal. This exercise of compiling the NRC has sparked a debate around its social, political and economic consequences of migration and the resulting outbreaks like there are concerns that NRC may end up incorrectly including or excluding people from the list. There is also an issue related to D voters (Dubious voters or Doubtful voters) i.e., those who are disenfranchised by the government on the account of their alleged lack of proper citizenship credentials and their inclusion will depend on decision of the Foreigners Tribunal. There is also a fear that this may end up targeting minorities in the country. On top of that Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 which makes illegal Hindu, Buddhist, Jain. Parsi and Christian migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible for Indian citizenship further creates apprehensions about alienation of minorities in the process. Also there are apprehensions that India will end up creating the newest section of stateless people, raising the spectre of home grown crisis that will echo that of Rohingya people who fled Myanmar to Bangladesh. It is tough to differentiate illegal immigrants from the genuine and legitimate citizens of Assam, as the language spoken by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and the indigenous Bengali speaking Muslim of Assam, is similar. Large areas of forest land was encroached upon by the immigrants for settlement and cultivation. The state experienced declining per cent of land area under forest from 39% in 1951-52 to about 30% now. The Common Integration and Cohesion found that tension usually exists with the presence of high levels of migration with other forms of social exclusion like poverty, poor housing etc. The influx of immigrants created a crisis of entity among the indigenous people. Their cultural survival will be in the het political control will be weakened and their employment opportunities will be undermined by such illegal migration. The recent Bodo-Muslim violence in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts has its root in the issue of illegal migration. Immigration has increased pressure on the part of statement, as the government has to increase the expenditure on education and health facilities to the immigrants. There is a fear particularly during a recession that immigrants ale jobs which would otherwise be taken by local people In particular place and circumstances, there can be competition and conflict Immigrants in every year have been adding a good number of people in Assam. It is one of the main reasons of population explosion. Due to this, there is a possibility of decreasing wage level. Most of the Bangladeshi immigrants have got their name enlisted in the voting list illegally, thereby claiming themselves as cities of the state. The immigrant's population act as a vote bank for the political parties in Assam. Pakistan's ISI has been active in Bangladesh, supporting militant movement in Assam. It is alleged that among the illegal migrants are also militants, who enter into Assam to carry out the terrorist activities. Despite all the repercussions and challenges that an NRC will have, it is very much in the good faith of the nation. It will provide a long-term solution to curb illegal migration from Bangladesh, by diplomatic and border management lets to yield desired results, as Bangladesh does not recognise any infiltration taking place from its territory to India and the porous border between India and Bangladesh hinders effective border management. The fear that illegal immigrants will change the demography of state from the mind of locals will be removed. It is also expected to deter future migrants from Bangladesh from entering Assam illegally as publication of the draft itself had created a perception that staying in Assam without valid documentation will attract detention/jail term and deportation. Thus, India has a very complex task ahead, to comply with the basic tenets of the Constitution i.e. safeguard the Fundamental Rights of the legitimate citizens of the country without violating the basic human rights of the migrants who may be excluded after the exercise as non-citizen class. The bordering states of the nation must be made secure of future illegal cross border movement as it is the foremost step in checking illegal immigration through porous borders. Hence, it will need comprehensive border management, bilateral treaties with neighbouring nations to identify and deport such migrants In doing so, India can actively engage International Bodies like UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Organisation for Migration (IOM), etc., for experience and expertise India can also initiate for the signing and ratification of the Refugee Convention of 1951 by members of SAARC. The road ahead amidst of all its apprehensions, the NRC is a forward-looking step in documenting India's citizens detects and deters infiltrators. The cooperation of the states will be the key for the success of NRC.",      
    "Topic53": "Right to Information (RTI) can be defined as an act of Parliament of India, ‘to provide for setting out practical regime of right to information for citizens’ Right to Information Act, 2005 mandates timely response to citizen requests for government information. It is an initiative taken by Department of Personnel and Training, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions provide a RTI Portal Gateway to the citizens for quick search of information the details of first Appellate Authorities, PIOs etc., amongst others, besides access to RTI related information/disclosures published on the web by various public authorities under the Government of India as well as the State Governments to promote transparency and accountability. Supreme Court landmark judgement in Mr Kulwal vs Jaipur Municipal Corporation 19% case directed that freedom of speech and expression provided under Article 19 of the Constitution, clearly implies Right to Information, as without information the freedom of speech and expression cannot be fully used by the citizens. This led to new dawn of governance by providing information. In 2004, United Progressive Alliance (LPA) government initiated drafting of RTI Act under National Advisory Council (NAC), with Aruna Roy as torchbearer for RTI Act formulation. National Campaign for People's Right to Information (NCPRI) played an active role in by arguing and compelling government to introduce Act which aims to improve transparency and accountability of government. Finally, RTI Act was passed in 2005 in Parliament thus, introducing a regime of transparency and accountability and re-establishment of faith in democracy. The act is applicable to whole of India (including Jammu and Kashmir which was not Applicable earlier). Some important provisions of law are: The Section 2(f) of act says that information means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being force. This in a way has led to transfer of democracy into the hands of people. Under Section 2(j) of the act, Right to Information means the right to information accessible under this act which is held by or under the control of any public authority. Most important feature of the act under Section 4(2) is that it put onus on government to provide disclosure of information by public authority. A time period of 30 days is assigned to public authority to furnish the information from the receipt of application. If information sought concerns the life or liberty of a person, it shall be supplied within 48 hours. Every public authority is under obligation to provide information on written request or request by electronic means. Three bodies are created to hear the application of information that is Public Information Officer, First Appellate Authority and Central Information Commission (CIC). Maximum time gap for 1st appeal is 30 day and time period for Appellate Authority is within 30 days or in exceptional cases 45 days from the date of receipt by public authority. Maximum time gap for 2nd appeal is 90 days since limit of supply of information is expired. Central Information Commission shall consist of 1 Chief Information Commissioner and upto 10 Central Information Commissioners. The Chief Information Commissioner shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office and shall not be eligible for reappointment. However, Section 8(1) contains provisions which restrict disclosure of information which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the state, relation with foreign state or lead to incitement of an offence. RTI relaxes restrictions placed by Official Secrets Act, 1923. The Right to Information Act, 2005 was amended through Right to Information (Amendment) Act, 2019. The Act has amended the provisions of salaries and services conditions of Information Commissioners at Central as well as State levels. Further, the term of Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioner has also been changed. Now, appointment will be for such term as may be described by Central Government. However, many critics are arguing that RTI amendment will undermine the independence of CIC. The RTI Act is regarded among one of the most successful laws of independent India Importance of RTI can be ascertained from the fact that nearly 60 lakh RTI applications are being filed every year. RTI has been seen as the key to stengthening participatory democracy and ushering in people centred governance. The act is essential for enjoying fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19 to make informed choices while exercising the choice during voting. The act ushers in transparency and accountability by arming citizens with a vital tool to inform them about what the government does with revenue it generates from them. The act was responsible for unearthing huge scams like Commonwealth Games and 2G Spectrum Case. Lack of awareness about Act can be understood from the fact only 36 per cent in rural and 38 per cent urban areas have heard of the RTI Act. Long Pendency of cases both at national as well as state level Most Information Commissions signals casual approach towards RTI Dilution of supplementary laws such as the one for Whistle-Blower Protection Act create situation where witness turns hostile. Political parties which receive substantial funding from government remains of the ambit of RTI Act which is serious flaw as they clearly comes under definition of public authority. Most of the time unnecessary information is sought thus, undermining the purpose of Act. Amendment to RTI Act increases the scope of political executives meddling in affairs of appointment and transfer of the Commissioners which can significantly alter the functioning of Act. The success of RTI act depends largely on how the people are united, organised and aware of their surroundings and their capacity to fight against corruption and unlawful activities. Further, it is suggested that every public authority should computerise their records for wide dissemination and to proactively publish certain categories of information so that citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally. It is also advised to the officers to provide the information which is brief, true and easily understood by citizens, this will avoid further complaints resulting into wastage of time, energy and money. All public information officers and appellate authorities need to be fully trained on what their responsibilities are under the law, how to manage applications and how to apply and interpret the law. The exemptions should be minimised so that there is more transparency. Section 26 of the Act states that the appropriate government authority may develop and organise educational programmes to advance the understanding of the public, especially disadvantaged communities, regarding how to exercise their rights. The government may resort to the major sources of awareness like radio, social media, television and newspapers. RTI is a significant step in the direction of good governance as it promotes transparency and accountability in the governance. Effective implementation of this act will make India as corruption free and inclusive society. The former Chief Information Commissioner of Jammu and Kashmir once said that ‘RTI is like a 10 rupee Public Information Litigation (PIL) for citizens’ which underscores the importance of RTI in achieving social justice.",      
    "Topic54": "Coalition government is a practice where a number of political parties join hands or form an alliance to run the government. Coalition politics is possible when the constituent political parties have some sort of commonality in their ideology. The concept of coalition politics in India is suitable because of its geographical diversity in terms of different physical regions, large population, diversity in culture and aspirations etc. In the Indian context, the concept of coalition politics started in late 1970s, but came into existence in late 1980s. Indian political parties have fragmented over years on the issue of ideology. Therefore, theorising the coalition politics essentially underlines the plurality, vastness and complexity of India. In a parliamentary democracy, it is assumed that the political party with majority would form the government and the rest would function as opposition. However, in a parliamentary system which allows for multi-party democracy, the problem arises when no political party is able to stake claim because of lack of majority numbers. It is then that political parties cobble up a coalition to stake claim for forming a government. When political parties came to this reality they also started forming coalition or alliance before election process. With mutual consent, they would contest only a limited number of seats. Therefore, the concept of coalition evolved with every passing year. India's engagement with coalition government came in 1937, in the pre-independence era. Jinnah appealed to Congress to form a coalition in Uttar Pradesh, but it did not materialise. However, coalition government became a reality in Punjab and NWFP (North-West Frontier Province) when Congress made an alliance with regional parties. At the national level in 1947 the interim government under the stewardship of Nehru was the first coalition among Congress, Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha and many others. In the post-independence era, the face of Indian politics changed in 1969. At this time, certain members of Congress withdrew support and congress became but with the support of Communist Party of India (CPI) and Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) from outside the Congress Government survived the scare. However, the 1967 election was a major watershed in the Indian politics. Causes such as intra-party factionalism, conflicts, defections, secession led to the demise of Congress in many states The Congress rule remained intact at the centre till year 1977. However, Janata Party came at the helm in 1977. Technically, it cannot be said to be a coalition government, but the way it made its exit was typical of coalition party. Various aspiring leaders and factions in the party pulled the amorphous grouping apart. In its true sense, political commentators mark the 1989 as the advent of coalition politics. In 1989, a coalition of National Front under the leader hip of VP Singh was formed. The government was supported by BJP, CPI, CFI(M) from outside. The coalition survived only for 11 months as the constituent parties parted ways on the issue of ideology. Another short lived coalition came immediately after when Chandra Shekhar formed government with the support of Congress, AIADMK, BSP etc. The coalition dissolved over the issue of government doing surveillance of Rajiv Gandhi Another coalition government at the centre came up when HD Deve Gowda formed government of United Front. A group of parties had the support of Congress, SP, DMK, etc. The Congress withdrew support on the issue if lack of communication between the coalition and Congress. Next coalition came under the Prime Ministership of Inder Kumar Gujaral. The coalition survived only for 11 months after INC withdrew support. The next coalition was led by AB Vajpayee in 1998-99. BJP led coalition was supported by AIADMK, BJP, Akali Dal etc. Since, BJP was unable to fulfil demands of AIADMK, the government fell down With AIADMK opting out of coalition this led to a vote of no confidence motion in Parliament that government lost by one vote (272-273), leading to fresh election in 1999. The next coalition was the most successful experiment of Indian politics. The National Democratic Alliance survived for 6 years under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The constituents were BJP, AIADMK, TDP, TMC etc Since 1999, all the governments formed were coalition government including the governments formed during 2004, 2009 in general election under the leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh and United Progressive Alliance. For three decades, until 2014, Indian voters refused to give any single largest political party a majority in Parliament. It was also the era of transition of the Indian economy. The country opened up, reformed and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. It is noteworthy to mention that the previous United Progressive Alliance government had trouble from left parties who held out on key legislative issues. The single rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) although introduced by the LIPA government never found enough support to get validation In most of these cases, the unholy nexus is fructified out of the greed of power and not as a convergence of ideology. There are several reasons for coalition politics. One of them is the inability of national parties to represent regional aspirations. Also they are not able to truly represent the diversity of India. Another reason is lack of leadership. Post-independence, the leadership commanded respect and trust. People started identifying themselves with regional leaders also the Mandal politics gave rise to caste based political parties. Moreover, political parties with religious identity also existed in India. These factors created a mass base in different parts of India. This also gave rise to regional political parties. Coalition government has its own inherent merits and demerits. When coalition governments are formed, several advantages are witnessed which include (i) Better representation of diverse ideas. (ii) Serve the nation or state well. (iii)In a coalition government that includes regional party, the regional demands are met adequately. (iv) The system becomes more democratic and power concentration comes under check Voters have more than one choice. On the other hand, it also has its negative effects which include (i) Defection takes place after election gets over. (ii) Parties resort to unethical means, offer critical government ministries in exchange for support. Sometimes, the ministers' merit is not a accordance with the demand of ministry. (iii) It gives rise to money and muscle politics (iv) As cobbling up a coalition requires these factors. Many times it has been seen that parties withdraw support when some unreasonable demands are not met. Indian politics has therefore made a full-fledged foray into the world of coalitions. Therefore, Hung Parliament and Hung Assembly has become a norm. However, coalition governments can truly represent the aspirations of citizens. To resolve the problem of legislators switching parties for political gains, the Parliament passed the 52nd Amendment in 1985, laying down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection. It will be a successful experiment when a coalition is formed on ideological congruity and not for vested interests. But coalition government concept has a long way to cover. With the increasing role of regional parties, the experiment will become more challenging.",      
    "Topic55": "One Nation, One Election is the method of holding single election for both One Lok Sabha and State Legislatures instead of separate and continuous elections In an all-party meeting in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, Prime Minister invited heads of all parties to discuss the 'One Nation, One Election' but the push for 'One Nation, One Election' came from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016 Ever since, there have been widespread discussions on holding simultaneous polls, with the Bharatiya Janta Party making a strong pitch for it. The idea of One Nation, One Election envisages a system where elections to all the States and the Lok Sabha will have to be held simultaneously. This will involve the restructuring of the Indian Election Cycle in a manner that elections to the states and the center synchronise. This would mean that the voters will cast their vote for electing the members of Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies on a single day, at the same time (or in a phased manner as the case may be). Few of the many reasons that are cited for the conduct of simultaneous elections include massive expenditure, diversion of security and civil staff from primary impact on governance due to the model code of conduct, disruption to normal public life etc. Simultaneous elections are not a new concept. They were followed till 1967. But with dissolution of some Legislative Assemblies in 1968 and 1969, followed by Lok Sabha in December 1970 resulted in confusion. Since then, separate elections to State and Parliament are held. The idea of reverting to simultaneous polls was initially mooted in the annual report of the Election Commission in 1983. The Law Commission's Report also referred to it in 1999. The Law Commission submitted a Draft Report to the government on 30th August, 2018, endorsing the proposal. It even recommended changes to the Constitution and the Electoral law so as to enable holding simultaneous polls and sought five Constitutional Amendments to get this off the ground. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has also favoured the concept in recent times. One proposal was to shift to simultaneous polls in a phased manner, where General Elections, State Assemblies and Union Territories elections were pending in 2018 or 2019 to be synchronised in 2019. These states were Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim, Telangana, Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Union Territory of NCT (Delhi). For such a synchronisation to happen, besides political consensus and extension of term upto six months in some states, amendments to the Constitution have to be made. Elections to the remaining State Legislative Assemblies and Union Territory with Legislature (Puducherry) will be synchronised by the end of 2021. Thereafter, elections to the Lok Sabha, all the State Legislative Assemblies and Union Territories (with legislatures) will be held simultaneously from 2024. The second option involved synchronisation in two batches. First, elections to the 12 State Legislative Assemblies and one Union Territory would have been synchronised with elections to the Lok Sabha in 2019 next, elections to the remaining State. Legislative Assemblies shall be synchronised with that of one Union Territory by the end of 2021. This would have made elections across the country synchronised in such a manner that they shall be held twice every five years. Unfortunately both the proposals could not materalise. In 2019, General election and state elections were held separately. Some of the challenges of simultaneous elections are given below Logistics Cost. The conduct of elections for the largest democracy in the world with nearly one billion voters is a gigantic task in itself. Hence, it needs to properly take care of the democratic values and ethical election mechanism without hindering the daily life cycle of common man and compromising with the developmental activities. At present, one voting machine is being used at every poll. For holding simultaneous elections, there shall be requirement of two EVM and VVPATs each, in addition to additional requirement of the polling staff and better security arrangements. Currently, ECI is already facing problems in storing EVMs after election. The process will also be unrealistic without any Constitutional Amendments and changes in the Representation of People Act, 1950 and 1951, which involve changes in the form of governance, basic feature and election mechanism in the country. This requires a deep political consensus and high public support which is tough to achieve given differing ideologies, thinking and perceptions. Holding simultaneous elections will also add to losing the relevance and mixing up of local issues with the national ones. National issues will be given higher priority over the local ones. There is also clear empirical evidence that most Indian voters tend to choose the same party when elections are held simultaneously to both Centre and State, with the relationship diminishing as elections are held farther away. Under a simultaneous elections regime, the state will be beholden to the Union Government for elections to its state, which goes against the very grain of political autonomy under the federal structure. The trend may also give birth to a personality cult in the Indian political arena which will hamper the tenets of governance. The right of a voter to exercise his/her choice twice in a span of five years and hold governments accountable is more important than just casting vote once and having no option to express opinion for the next five years. The core problem area which is coming in the way of implementing this is the Parliamentary form of Government which India practices. In this, the Government is accountable to the lower house, be it at the level of the State Assemblies or in the Lok Sabha. If the government is accountable to the lower house, given the nature of the Parliamentary form of Government, the Government can fall before it completes its term and the moment the government falls, there has to be fresh elections. Distance Between Voters and Representatives Apart from that, it also has several intrinsic consequences like decrease in the public-politician interaction as frequent elections in the country bring politicians back to public frequently whereas cutting down on elections would mean making them lazy for the re of the term. The terms of various state governments and center have to be matched, as against irregular ones currently. This requires extension of and early dissolution of few state assemblies which is against the constitutional mandates and may involve political favouritism. Though, the road to simultaneous elections is not an easy one, but it does provide several merits to soothe and the ailments of the hurdles. The process will leave the election process easy, less expensive and more productive as the unprecedented cost, manpower and time wasted on multiple elections at frequent intervals will be cut drastically. The precious money from tax payers pocket will be better spent on developmental activities rather than movement of election equipment, security forces and manpower for election. Parties individually spend a lot on election campaigning, the amount that could be put to better use if they have to do that only at once for the general election as well as the state election. The government can focus more on development and welfare policies as half of the time spent concentrating on strategies for the upcoming election will reduced If elections are conducted at a designated interval, politicians will focus more on long-term development. Security forces also have to be less diverted for the electoral work as terrorism remains a strong threat to India. One Nation, One Election would be a good change if it could be carried out with the proper execution of policies and rules, taking care of the rising need for good administrative staff and security. The Standing Committee has said that solutions should be found to reduce the frequency of elections in India so that government machinery, as well as Election Commission, can get some time for other administrative works.",      
    "Topic56": "The term ‘Judicial activism’ was coined for the first time by Arthur Schlesinger Jr in his article The Supreme Court: 1947, published in Fortune magazine in 1947. Though, the history of judicial activism dates back to 1803 when the concept of judicial review was evolved by Chief Justice Marshall in celebrated case of Marbury vs Madison. The emergence of judicial review gave birth to a new movement which is known as judicial activism. Judicial activism refers to a philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions. The Constitution of India divides the powers of the government into three branches i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary. It is when the judiciary steps into the shoes of the executive and the legislature and embarks on the work of law making rather than interpreting laws, it is deemed to be judicial activism. Unlike American Constitution, Indian Constitution itself provides scope or space for emergence of judicial activism by virtue of Articles 13, 32, 226, 141 and 142. (i) Article 13 conferred wide power of judicial review to the Apex Court. (ii) Article 32 and Article 226 makes the Supreme Court and High Court respectively as the protector and guarantor of the Fundamental Rights. (iii) Article 141 indicates that the power of the Supreme Court is to declare the validity and constitutionality of law and not enact it, but in the course of its function to interpret the law, it alters the law. (iv) Article 142 enables the Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction to pass such order or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. The causes which give rise to judicial activism include expansion of rights of hearing in the administrative process, excessive delegation without limitation, expansion of judicial review over administration, promotion of open government, indiscriminate exercise of contempt power, exercise of jurisdiction when non-exist, over extending the standard rules of interpretation in its search to achieve economic, social and educational objectives and passing of orders which are unworkable. Judicial activism in India, in its truest sense, dates back to the commencement of the Constitution. Hence, the study of judicial activism in India from the historical perspective is confined from the period-1950 to 1977, the period of 1978 onwards being the post-emergency era or the present perspective. The term judicial activism was explained and recognised by the Supreme Court in Golaknath's case wherein the court laid down the judicial principle of prospective overruling by giving wider beneficial interpretation of Article 13 of the Constitution. But in real sense, the history of judicial activism in India began in late seventies with the introduction of Public Interest Litigation (PIL). In India was started by justice Krishna lyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. The term 'Public Interest Litigation' means any litigation conducted for the benefit of public or for removal of some public grievance. In simple words, i mean any citizen seeking public welfare can move the court for the public cause by filing a petition in the Supreme Court. The concept of PIL is in consonance with the principles enshrined in Article 39A of the Constitution of India to protect and deliver prompt social justice with the help of law. Justice Bhagwati in SP Gupta vs Union of India case 1981 (judges transfer case) firmly established the validity of the Public Interest Litigation. If we look at the decision given by the Supreme Court in several PIL, it is evident that most of the PIL. Extends to environmental pollution, convicted prisoners under trials, personal liberty, corruption etc. The court has given several important directions to the executive as well as to the legislature at the instance of the PIL. One of the criticisms is that the PIL strategy is a status-quo approach of the count to avoid any change in the system. Another criticism is that judicial activism is coming in between the concept of separation of power. It is also believed that the PIL will further aggravate the issue of pending cases in the court. According to another view, the misuse of PIL has reached ridiculous stage and petitions are filed over petty issues like student-teacher strike, shortage of buses, painting of road signs and so on. Judicial activism has risen mainly due to the failure of the executive and legislatures to act according to the laws framed and bills passed. Secondly, it has arisen also due to the fact that there is a doubt that the legislature and executive have failed to deliver the goods and promises as expected by the citizens of this country. Thirdly, it occurs because the entire system has been plagued by ineffectiveness and inactiveness. The violation of basic human rights has also led to judicial activism. Finally, due to the misuse and abuse of some of the provisions of the Constitution, judicial activism has gained significance. Article 50 under Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) talks about separating judiciary from the executive in the public services of the state. This means that both Judiciary and Executive should not interfere in their respective domains. Judiciary should remember this guideline of the Constitution at the time of delivering judicial decisions. Many a times, it has been seen that in the name of justice and judicial activism, judiciary has overreached its domain and entered in the legislative domains e.g. banning liquor shops on National Highways. These types of orders have the character of a law which is exclusively a domain of legislature however under Article 142; Supreme Court can do anything in the course of complete justice. The recent example of judicial activism is when Supreme Court took cognisance of migrant workers issue in the COVID-19 lockdown and saw inadequacies and lapses in dealing the crisis. The court ordered the centre and the states to immediately provide transport, food and shelter free of cost to the stranded migrant workers. The Supreme Court directed that no fare should be charged from migrant workers and the fare must be shared by the states, both origininating and receiving. During the past decade, many instances of judicial activism have gained prominence. Bhopal gas tragedy and the Jessica Lal murder case are among the top two ones. The latter was open and shut case for all. Money and muscle power tried to win over the good. But lately, it was with the help of judicial activism that the case came to a strong decision. In the 1980s, two remarkable developments in the Indian legal system provided a strong impetus to judicial activism in India. There was a broadening of existing environmental laws in the country and judicial activity through public interest litigation began in earnest in India. The famous case of judicial activism in India is the majority judgement in the Keshavananda Bharati case (the Fundamental Rights case). Further, the case of National Human Rights Commission vs State of Arunachal Pradesh, 2G Spectrum case 2012 are important cases of judicial activism. Supreme Court's Directions on Judicial Activism Recently, Members of Parliament united against judicial activism' criticising the judiciary for allegedly interfering in day-to-day administration of the government. In view of such allegations and to prevent judicial activism' being converted into judicial overreach', the Supreme Court issued the following directions (i) the court must encourage genuine and bonafide PIL and effectively discourages and curbs the PIL filed for extraneous considerations. (ii) The court should prima facie verify the credentials of the petitioner before entertaining a PIL. (iii) The court should be fully satisfied that substantial public interest is involved before entertaining the petition. In a nutshell, the power of judicial review is recognised as a part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. The activist role of the judiciary is implicit in the said power. Judicial activism is absolutely necessary for democracy because without an alert and enlightened judiciary, the democracy will be reduced to an empty shell. When our chosen representatives have failed to give us a welfare state, let it spring from the judiciary. Only thing the judiciary must keep in mind is that while going to deliver justice to common man, it must not overstep the limitations prescribed by the Constitution.",      
    "Topic57": "Reservation is a form of affirmative and supportive action taken by the government, where some seats and posts in private and government institutes governance and legislature, employment and other public goods and services are reserved for socially and educationally backward communities, castes and tribes. Reservation occupies an important place in our Indian Constitution. It was provided under the Constitution to help the deprived section of the society. The main purpose of reservation policy was to rectify the situation created by historical social and caste system and the economic deprivation, which is the reason for the backwardness of the marginalised sections of the country. In simple terms, it is about facilitating access to seats in the government jobs, educational institutions and even legislatures to certain sections of the population. These sections have faced historical injustice due to their caste identity. As a quota based affirmative action, the reservation can also be seen as positive discrimination. Before 2019, the reservation was provided mainly on the basis of social and educational backwardness.  Historically, William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in 1882 originally conceived the idea of caste-based reservation system. The reservation system that exists today, in its true sense, was introduced in 1933 when British Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald presented the 'Communal Award. The award made the provision for separate electorates for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Dalits. Later, Poona Pact was signed by Gandhi and Ambedkar that provided for a single Hindu electorate with certain reservations in it. After Independence, Constitution of India provided for the reservation of seats for SC and STs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the basis of population ratios. The initial reservations were only for SCs and ST's under Article 15(4) and 16(4). OBCs were included in the ambit of reservation in 1991 as per the recommendations of Mandal Commission under Article 15(5). In 2019 Economically Weaker Sections were also provided with reservation under the Article 15(6) and 16(6) through 103rd Constitutional Amendment Act. The Preamble of our Constitution proclaims the resolution of people of India to constitute India into a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular and Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. The concept of equality, enshrined in the Preamble has also found expression as a Fundamental Right in Article 14 to 18. The following constitutional provisions cover enhancement of the social and educational advancements of the deprived sections are (i) Article 15 (4) of the Constitution puts an obligation on the state to frame any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (ii) Article 16 (4) ensures participation of backward classes in employments or posts or appointments to public offices in the state, if they are not adequately represented. (iii) Article 46 of the Constitution states that ‘the state shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and, in particular of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation’. (iv) Articles in the Part XVI of the Indian Constitution deal with reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Anglo-Indians in the State legislative assemblies, Lok Sabha and District Autonomous Councils. (v) Article 334 specifies the duration for which reservation is to be applicable. (vi) Article 338 provides for a National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Article 338A and 3388 provide National Commission for Scheduled Tribes and National Commission for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) respectively with a purpose to provide safeguards against the exploitation and to promote and protect their social, educational, economic and cultural interests. The Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) class within the unreserved category was cheated in 2019 by the Union Government in order to provide benefits to the economically backward sections and classes of the country, Consequently, the 103rd Constitutional, Amendment Act was enacted in 2019 to ensure 10% reservation for them taking the tally to 59.5% in Central educational institutes and public employment. Thus, after the 103rd Constitutional Amendment, economic cowardness is also considered for providing reservation. The system of reservations in education has caused division of the student community on caste-basis much like it has divided the society on same terms Instead of having the feeling of coming from one nation, students mostly loyalties to their caste-based identities. Students who put in their best to make to the merit list of reputable institutes disheartened if they fail to get an admission. They get discouraged and depressed and such situations lead to frustration. Reservation policies in India have consistently attracted outrage from some section of the society. Jats, the dominant community, spread over Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh who already have reservation in Haryana, Rajasth and Uttar Pradesh wanted inclusion in the centre's OBC list as well The Cent government had given them this status but the decision was struck down by the Supreme Court on 2018. Contrastingly, the Maratha Reservation Quota act which provides for 16% reservation to Maratha community in State of Maharashtra was upheld by the Bombay High Court in 2019, though it sought reduction in the quota Rajput Rajasthan, Kapus in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and Patel Patidars in Gur are among many others in the list of those demanding reservations in the various categories. Some of the reasons why the policy needs review are (i) Reservation destroys self-respect, so much so that competition is no longer on to determine the best but the most backward. (ii) Reservations are the biggest enemy of meritocracy which is the foundation of many progressive countries. (iii) It has become a tool to meet narrow political ends through invoking class loyalties and primordial identities. (iv) The dominant and elite class within the backward castes has appropriated the benefits of reservation and the most marginalised within the backward castes have remained marginalised. Though, caste-based reservation will help the backward students to get equal opportunities, reservation in higher educational institutions will affect not only the quality of the education but the standard of the institutions and the overall development of the country as well. Caste-based reservation only helps politicians to create vote banks. Reservation is fair, as far as it provides appropriate positive discrimination for the benefit of the downtrodden and economically backward sections of the society. However, when it tends to harm the society and ensures privileges to some at the cost of others for narrow political ends, it should be done away with, as soon as possible. When more aspire for backwardness rather than of forwardness, the country itself stagnates Meritocracy should not be polluted by injecting relaxation of entry barriers, rather than it should be encouraged by offering financial aid to the underprivileged. A strong political will is indispensable to find equilibrium between justice to the backwards, equity for the forward and efficiency for the entire system.",      
    "Topic58": "Health is a resource for the physical, social and mental wellbeing for living a life full of prosperity. Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages is important for building prospers societies Healthy people are the foundation for healthy economies as healthy populations live longer, are more productive and save more. So, a nation needs to ensure healthy lives. Turing healthy lives for all require a strong commitment by the nations. The benefits of strong health initiatives outweigh the cost. Indian Constitution under Article 47 directs the state to raise the level of nutrition and standard of living of its people and mentions the improvement of public health among its primary duties on the health parameters; India has made a great improvement over the past decades. The life expectancy has and 69 years, infant mortality rate, less than five mortality rate and the rate of disuse incidence are declining. Many diseases such as polio, guinea worm disease yawns and tetanus have been eradicated. Yet the poor, marginalised and the vulnerable people are not able to avail healthcare and are deprived of good quality health services. It is in this context that the government launched the Ayushman Bharat health initiative so that the marginalised and the downtrodden are able to get healthcare benefits and medical treatment free of cost in any government or private empanelled hospital all over the country. The family will be eligible for secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities. With the raging coronavirus outbreak in the world that adversely affected India, healthcare for all is considerably difficult in a country where only 20% of the population has health insurance coverage. There is a large group that is missing out India has a vast healthcare system, but there remains many differences in quality between rural and urban areas as well as public and private health care Indian healthcare system is run by both public and private healthcare providers but they have their own limitations Public sector hospitals in India are overburdened, under staffed and also faces shortages of drops and equipment’s. The private healthcare system is responsible for providing majority of healthcare in India but it is very expensive. According to data published by National Sample Survey Office, 55 million Indians are pushed into poverty in a single year because of having to fund their own healthcare. Out of this, 38 million fall below the poverty line due to spending on medicines alone. To overcome inefficiencies and achieve a healthy nation with high standard of living and improved quality of life, Indian government is continuously working to formulate health promoting laws The National Health Policy launched in 2018 which mandated a comprehensive healthcare scheme to achieve the vision of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is an example of such an effort. The policy has been put in place with launch of the initiative known as Ayushman Bharat in 2018. This initiative has been designed to provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to the citizens and meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its underlining commitment, which is 'leave no one behind. Ayushman Bharat also known as Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana is a health insurance scheme to cater to the poor, lower section of society and the vulnerable population. It is a dedicated attempt to move from segmented approach of healthcare service delivery to a comprehensive need-based healthcare service. It aims to undertake path breaking interventions to address healthcare issues covering prevention, promotion and ambulatory care, at primary, secondary and tertiary levels: The scheme has two interrelated components known as Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) Over 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) will be setup by transforming existing Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres. These centres would deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) that will bring healthcare closer to the homes of people. It will be covering both maternal and child health services and non-communicable diseases. The main aim is disease prevention and health promotion to curb the increasing epidemic of non-communicable diseases. There will be free essential drugs and diagnostic services. It will emphasise on keeping people healthy by choosing healthy behaviours and make changes in their lives that reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases. The second component under Ayushman Bharat is PM-JAY (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana), which aims at providing health insurance cover of 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation. It aims to cover over 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries), which makes it the largest health cover initiative in the world. There is no gap on family size and age. It will create a system of demand-led healthcare reforms that meet the immediate hospitalisation needs of the eligible beneficiary family in a cashless manner, thus, insulating the family from catastrophic shock. It will help the poor families by providing financial protection for selected secondary and tertiary healthcare hospitalisations. This will reduce catastrophic out of pocket health expenditure, improve access to quality health care and meet the unmet need of the population for hospitalisation care. PM-JAY will cover the bottom 40% of poor and vulnerable population. The households included are based on the deprivation and occupational criteria of Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011 for rural and urban areas respectively. PM JAY will secure those who have pre-existing illness and make treatment in all public hospitals mandatory. This means that those who require medical treatment cannot be turned away. The scheme is completely funded by the Government, and cost of implementation is shared between Central and State Governments At the implementation level, the States are given the flexibility to use their own database if they were already implementing a health insurance/assurance scheme and were covering more families than those eligible as per the Socio Economic Caste Census, 2011 database. As the new initiative is comprehensive, it will provide cashless cover of upto 5 lakh per family under the following components-medical examination, treatment and consultation, pre-hospitalisation, medicines, non-intensive and intensive care services, diagnostic and laboratory investigations, medical implant services (where necessary), accommodation benefits, food services, complications arising during treatment and post-hospitalisation follow-up care upto 15 days. Since, it is an entitlement-based scheme where there is no advance enrolment process, making beneficiaries aware of the scheme is the most critical aspect. Information, education and communication activities are also carried out to educate beneficiaries about the scheme. Various modes of communication such as leaflets, booklets, hoardings, TV, radio spots etc are being used for creating a comprehensive communication strategy for spreading the desired messages across the target audience. A detailed communication strategy has been developed by NHA (National Health Authority) which is to be implemented at both National and State levels. NHA is also working on the overall cooperation and capacity-building with the states for implementation and development of communication strategy required for increasing awareness at the state level. The scheme is being implemented under two models: Assurance model and Insurance model - Under the assurance model, the scheme is directly implemented by the State Health Agency without the intermediation of the insurance company. The financial risk of implementing the scheme is borne by the Government in this model. Under the Insurance Model, the State Health Agency competitively selects an insurance company through a tendering process to manage PM-JAY in the State. Based on market determined premium, it pays premium to the insurance company per eligible family for the policy period and insurance company, in turn, does the claims settlement and payments to the service provider.  The financial risk for implementing the scheme is also borne by the insurance company in this model. National portability is one of the key positive under Ayushman Bharat. It is a positive step towards achieving the goals of universal healthcare. By this, the beneficiaries can move throughout the country for their treatment. There is a provision for Pradhan Mantri Arogya Mitra (PMAM). Its main function is to guide, identify and assist the beneficiaries in availing the treatment. When implemented fully, this huge initiative will help India progressively achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) It will also ensure improved access and affordability of quality secondary and tertiary care services through a combination of public hospitals and private healthcare providers. This will significantly reduce out of pocket expenditure for hospitalisation and reduce the financial risk arising out of catastrophic health related illness and impoverishment for poor and vulnerable families. Though Ayushman Bharat is a welcome step taken by the government for universal health coverage but it has certain limitations Funding is the main concern to run this scheme smoothly. Shortages of Doctors and Specialists are also one of the major concern, most of the hospitals across India have this problem. This scheme is confined only to weaker sections of society identified as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census, 2011. Hence, it will not be called as universal coverage in true sense. Many states lack internal capacities and sophisticated procedures for implementing national portability which is a key feature of PM-JAY. Another limitation is that it requires the states to contribute 40% of the expenditure but most states are under a poor fiscal situation. The infrastructure is already severely stressed in the Tier II and Tier III cities. There is also an urgent need to strengthen the healthcare professionals, skilling & reskilling programs. Ayushman Bharat is not only a positive step towards universal health coverage, it will also help in poverty reduction and employment generation. By providing health coverage to all, it keeps the disease out of door. Thus, the initiatives like Ayushman Bharat are boon to society which helps to achieve good health to harness the potential of demographic dividend. Referring to the Ayushman Bharat scheme, World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has stated that, ‘COVID-19 pandemic, which has presented challenges for several nations could be an opportunity for India to speed up the health insurance scheme such as Ayushman Bharat’.",      
    "Topic59": "Geographical indications are development meter, preserver of environment, Ge employment generator, protector of traditional knowledge and export booster. They are the tools to make life better. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) have never been more economically and politically significant or controversial than they are at present. In a knowledge based economy, there is no doubt that an understanding of IPRS is indispensable in informed policy making in all areas of human development. One of the budding fields of intellectual property is Geographical Indications (GI). Every region has its claim to fame and it has to be protected. Geographical indications are generally traditional products, produced by rural, marginal or indigenous communities over generations that have gained a reputation in the local, national or international market due to their specific unique qualities. What is Geographical Indication (GI)? A Geographical Indication (GI) refers to a name or sign used on products that have a specific geographic origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Gls have been defined under Article 22(1) of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement as ‘Indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a member or a region or a locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographic origin.’ Gls are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirits drinks, handicrafts and industrial products. As the qualities depend on the geographical place of production, there is a strong link between the product and its original place of production. The use of a geographical indication acts as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities like it is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin. The GI tag ensures that none other than those registered as authorised users are allowed to use the popular product name. In the recent times, there are few new products that have got GI tag. These follows (i) In April 2020, Black rice of Manipur, also called the Chakhao', Gorakhpur Terracotta and Kodaikanal Malai Poondu of Tamil Nadu got its Gl tag. (ii) Kashmir saffron which is cultivated and harvested in Karewa (highlands) of J&K, has been given the GI tag in May 2020. The spice is grown in some regions of Kashmir, including Pulwama, Budgam, Kishtwar and Srinagar. (iii) The famous Banarasi Paan, Banarasi Langra (Mango variety), Barabanki handlooms of Uttar Pradesh are ready to get G1 tag soon, as notified by the government. The GIs had to be protected because of widespread imitation and ineffective protection in different countries. These products had to fight for their reputation for market access using their names because of a large number of imitated products. Thus, to prevent GI from becoming generic and establish a rule based system which is open, fair and provides for an enforcement mechanism, protection of Gis became essential. A Geographical Indication can be protected by three approaches i.e., sui generis' systems (i.e., special regimes of protection), using collective or certification marks and methods focusing on business practices, including administrative product approval schemes. Among the major developing economies, India has an efficient GI tagging mechanism. India on becoming a signatory to Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) enacted the Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 which has come into force with effect from 15th September, 2003 The objectives of this act is three fold (i) First is to have a specific law governing the geographical indications of goods in the country which could adequately protect the interest of producers of such goods. (ii) Second is to exclude unauthorised persons from misusing geographical indications and to protect consumers from deception. (iii) Third is to promote goods bearing Indian geographical indications in the export market. Further, India has set a Geographical Indications Registry with All India Jurisdiction in Chennai under the Registrar of Geographical Indication who is also the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks. The benefits of geographical indications are numerous. The first GI tagged product in India was Darjeeling tea which attained this status in 2004-2005. Currently, there are more than 500 GI tagged products in India GI registration is beneficial for India as it confers legal protection to geographical indications in India and prevents unauthorised use of a registered geographical indication by others which helps in boosting exports of such products. This promotes economic prosperity of producers. Also, it enables a country in seeking legal protection in other WTO member countries. With the protection assured by GI registration, the market is developed and encroachment of market by pirated and counterfeit products is prevented. Further, it ensures consumer of the genuineness of the product and of quality assurance and promotes brand building. Gls are strongly connected to socio-economic development, along the lines of sustainability in countries rich in traditional knowledge. The recognition and protection in the markets of the names of these products allows the community of producers to invest in maintaining the specific qualities of the product on which the reputation is built. It enhances the capacity of producers to invest economic gains into higher quality products and access niche markets. This drives a virtuous circular economy. The application of circular economy will ensure socio-economic returns in the long run to attain sustainable growth. Geographical indication contributes to rural development encompassing environmental protection, economic development and social well-being. It helps in strengthening sustainable local food production and supply, structuring of the supply chain around a common product reputation linked to origin and give a higher retail price benefit percentage to raw material producers for better distribution. Geographical indication helps in preservation of traditions and traditional knowledge, builds identity based prestige and boosts tourism. It helps in environmental protection as it promotes preservation of the natural resources on which the product is based. It boosts the economy via its spill-over effects. Gl registration helps to prevent unauthorised use of the product and promotes financial gain to the producers. It helps in stabilisation of prices, improving marketing strategy, generating employment and income. The issue of GI tag has been debated in India and globally at various forums like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The major challenges faced by goods applying for Gl status are-origin of the goods for identifying geographic territory, registration of Gls, monitoring and controlling specified processes, procedure and quality of Gl protected goods, protection of Gls from infringement and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Indian products are still learning to explore the idea of GI in their fullest and are battling to reap the benefits of our art, heritage and food that could bring us on the international trade scenario. Even with our GI regime being over 15 years, with Gls for more than 300 Indian products like Rasagolla, that triggered a bitter tussle between West Bengal and Odisha, and Basmati Rice, Navara rice, Kolhapuri Chappal etc. are shared by multiple states. It results in conflicts among communities due to similar and competing products. India's GI legacy started with Darjeeling tea, which was a good step to check authenticity and promote a premium product in the market and among the people. However, government need to make strong efforts like EU and USA do for their premium products. It is worth mentioning that 80% of French champagne have GI tags, with the government's active promotion.",      
    "Topic60": "India has a huge number of young people as compared to the leading economy of the world where the populations ageing 63% of India's population is m the age group of 15-59 years. It is estimated that this working age population well be at its peak around the year 2041 when working age people are expected to around 60% of the population. If India is able to reap the benefits of this demographic dividend, it would result in great economic growth. If right policies are made in terms of social and economic spheres, so that health and education can be improved, then this young population has the potential to generate enormous wealth. The most important ingredient required for reaping this demographic dividend 21st century skills so that these young people can be empowered and their aspirations can be fulfilled. These skills should be imparted to every young person who seeks to be employed after completing his/her academics, irrespective of their caste, class, gender, race, ethnicity, etc. Skills and knowledge are the driving forces of economic growth Investments in skilling the young men and women of the country are much better than investments in any other sectors. Unfortunately, at present, only about 4.6% of India's workforce has received some formal training as compared to the workforce in countries such as Germany where over 75% of people in the total workforce have received some formal training. This value is over 95% of the total workforce for South Korea. Thus, there is a huge mismatch between skills, academic training, and employment, where employers are not able to discover suitably trained people and youth are not able to find the kind of jobs that they aspire for. According to Indian Skill Report (2019), only 46% of youth graduating from colleges are employable in some sector of the economy. The ICE 360° Survey on skill level in India classified skills into four types Level 1- skills involving simple and routine physical or manual tasks. For e.g. hawker, street vendor, gardener, cook, construction worker etc. Level 2-skills involving operations of machinery and electronic equipment. For e.g. plumber, electrician, mechanic etc. Level 3 - skills involving written records of work, simple calculation and good personal communication skills. For e.g. clerical, supervisory level etc.  Level 4-skills involving decision making e.g. doctors, lawyers, scientist, engineer etc. The Survey report states that nearly 56% of the labour market is dominated by people from Skill level 2 whereas about 30% of the people are at Skill level 1 only. Skill levels 1 and 2 are mainly associated with low paid informal sector jobs. The India of 21st century requires higher level skills. Level 3 and 4 skills are associated with higher educational qualifications. But there is also a need to reskill the level 1 and level 2 workers so that they can also align themselves, with the needs of the 21st century. Thus, skilling India requires both-filling the gap in skilling the informal workers and producing more skills required for formal sector jobs. India is among the fastest growing economies of the world. India's economy has changed significantly in the last 20 years. The shift of employment generation is towards the service sector. It is estimated that 110 million additional skilled individuals will be required across 22 key sectors by 2022. Manufacturing would contribute towards half of these additional jobs. The key sectors where additional skills will be required include sectors such as Auto and Auto components, Electronics and IT hardware, Food processing, Healthcare, Tourism, Agriculture, Leather, Capital goods, Telecom, Security, Rubber goods, Textiles etc. Many of these sectors employ unorganised sector migrant labourers. Formalising these sectors to improve the skills of these workers should be a high priority. The sectors which are growing fast will require new skills that are relevant to the demands of the 21th century. The sectors which are well established will also undergo transformation and will require newer skills relevant to the demand for these jobs. Most of the employment in India is in the agriculture and informal sector. These two sectors will require upskilling of the workforce on a prioritised basis. In this direction, efforts will be taken by both the Union and the State Governments through their organisations involved in skill development such as Industrial Training Institutes (ITIS), government funded programs like Kaushal Vikas Yojana and privately funded bodies sponsored by the government. There are various issues in skill development that need to be resolved. The issues are (1) there is a wide skills mismatch between the skills needed by industry to employ the people and skills imparted by college or school education. This is mainly due to the lack of industry faculty interaction that the skills provided by traditional educational and training institutes do not up suiting industry needs. As a result of this scenario, though people are skilled but they do not get suitable employment in the industry. (2) The current infrastructure facilities required to skill youth in India are inadequate. There are not many trained and highly skilled trainers available in the country. There is an urgent need to cultivate highly educated and skilled teachers so that skills can be imparted to the students quickly and efficiently. (3) Unorganised Sector Almost 93% of workforce is engaged in the unorganised sector. Providing skills to these people and mapping their existing skill set t not possible. On the other hand, the rate of job growth in informal sector i estimated to be twice that of the formal sector. (4) The existing grant based, free training programs available today have their own limitations in terms of quality and employability. The focus is on quantity of people trained as opposed to the quality of training this leaves essential gaps in skills of individuals who are enrolled in these programs. Many of these programs remain unaligned to demands of the industry. Hence, they defect the objective of skilling. (5) Efforts in skill development ecosystem have largely been devoid of industry/employer linkages. This has created gaps in terms of specific needs of skills and competency required by the employer and those possessed by the trainee. If industry and academia will not collaborate, it will not be able to fill in the gaps between demand and supply of existing skills. (6) Skill development programs of the Central and State governments are overlapping with each other, multiple ministries and departments are engaged in skilling initiatives and it is without any coordination. This lack of coordination has resulted in multiplicity of norms, procedures, curriculum, certifications etc. (7) The enrolment capacity of our skilling institutes is quite large but still there is low enrolment in these institutes such as ITIs and polytechnics. This is due to low awareness among youth about the skill development programs. There is an urgent need to impart newer skills to the youth in India. The following measures should be taken to provide skills to youth in new India (i) Enhanced Expenditure on Training and Education Government allocation on education sector is very low. The spending is only 2% of the total GDP as compared to developed countries which spend higher amounts on their education sector. In the long run, only providing skills will not be sufficient Skilling India will require investment in education and training. Vocational education shall become a part of education system itself so that the younger students can be provided and introduced to the industry relevant skills in their lives earlier. (ii) India needs expert and efficient trainers that can provide skills to the youth. India lacks trained professional trainers that become a major hinderance in skilling youth. Teacher training programs should be started both at the central as well as the state level so that well trained skill providers can be produced. (iii) A skill survey should be done at the unorganised sector so that the skill deficiencies of our unorganised workers can be measured and the gap can be filled. The skill survey can map the required skills level and accordingly capacity of institutions for planning the skill development programs can be built. (iv) Increased Participation and Collaboration Industry and academics should participate and collaborate with each other such that the demand and supply gap between higher education institutions and industry can be filled up. This gap filling and collaboration will ensure that quality of skills can be maintained according to the changing requirements of the economy. (v) There is a gender imbalance in the job market both in terms of numbers of individual of both genders as well as their pay scale. Skilling India will require enhanced participation of women in skill training institutes. This would ensure that the gender which makes up almost 50% of the population of India does not remain isolated. Thus, women participation should be raised to realise full potential of India's youth. Increased participation of stakeholders, mobilising adequate investments, support of the government etc. is necessary for skill development. There is a need for coordinated effort from all stakeholders including government ministries at the state and central level, industry, educational and training institutes and students, trainees and job seekers. Newer technologies will surely help in fulfilling the objectives of a skilled India. The movement of skilling India should focus on skilling in emerging technologies to enable India to transition into a global knowledge economy.",      
    "Topic61": "An agrarian country like India where more than 50 per cent population is dependent on agriculture as means of employment and sustenance, 'land' a very important role. Land reform usually refers to equitable distribution of land between all the strata of society. Before independence our agrarian society was governed by semi-feudal principles. This society was broadly divided into four classes the cultivating holders, the intermediaries cum cultivating holders, tenants-at-will and agricultural labourers. The agricultural labourers were the unemployed, underemployed and seasonal employed class of the agrarian society. Other classes constituted small and large land owners. This feudal structure of society led to the backwardness of society and sheer poverty among the rural masses, as land is the major source of wealth and social hierarchy. In the pre-independence era three types of land revenue systems existed in India, namely: 'Ryotwari, Zamindari and Mahalwari'. The Ryotwari system started in Madras in 1772 under this system, the government had set responsibility of paying land revenue to the cultivator. In this system no middleman existed. On the other hand, Zamindari system which started in 1793 under Lord Cornwallis, was the harshest one. It went on to create intermediaries between state and the cultivator. Started in West Bengal and later on adopted in other states, the system remained in existence till our independence. Landlords owned the land and rented them out to cultivators. However, the landlords never cultivated the land themselves but only collected revenue from the cultivators. The Company fixed the revenue at a very high rate which the zamindars extracted from the poor cultivators ultimately the farmers suffered greatly. The revenue was fixed regardless of the harvest. It made rent collection as a perennial problem. Similar to these two, a third system was Mahalwari system. 'Mahals' signified villages. This system mostly was in practice in Western Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab etc. Here, the whole of village or mahal was responsible for payment of land revenue to the state. Therefore, the ownership of land was under a village body. The system was started by Lord William Bentick. After Independence in order to get rid of the discussed rigidities, a committee was set-up under the Chairmanship of JC Kumarappa which was known as Agrarian Reforms Committee. It submitted its report in 1949 and became the main plank of land reform in our country. The committee suggested abolition of intermediaries; fixing land ceilings holding and redistribution of surplus land among the marginalised. However, the time lag between passing the law and its implementation allowed for finding loopholes in the legislation. Intermediaries continued to exist even after abolition of Zamindari as they made legal or illegal transfers of land in the name of their relatives without actually being the cultivator of the land Agrarian reform also suggested for tenancy reforms. It prohibited any system of cultivation by the tenants. The Planning Commission of India sums up the objectives of the land reform in two comprehensive steps. First, to remove the impediments which hinders the agricultural production. Second, to eliminate all elements of exploitation and social injustice within the agrarian system. It will provide security to the cultivator and assure equality of status and opportunity to all the sections of the rural population. The Constitution makers also understood the importance of land. Therefore, land was made a Fundamental Right under Article 31. But due to innumerable litigations being filed in this regard, 1st Constitutional Amendment changed the provision and made it a legal right. Some other notable efforts towards land reform in India are Consolidation of land holdings, Bhoodan movement and Cooperative farming Consolidation of land holding is aggregating of small fragments of land in an area and then purchasing it from the owner. Due to inheritance of land, the property gets smaller with passing generation as land is passed from the father to his sons and daughters and so on. Therefore, to make agriculture viable, government resorted to this technique. One of the most important events in the history of land reform is the Bhoodan Movement of 1951 that was started by Acharya Vinoba Bhave. He made an emotive appeal to rich landlords and appropriated almost 54.60 lakh acres of land. But this effort was not successful, land donated was mostly not conducive for agriculture and only 25% were distributed. Similarly cooperative farming was also promoted to solve the problems of sub-division and fragmentation of land holdings. However, in India the concept failed miserably as people were not agreeing to part with their land for community welfare. After independence several land reform programmes were started with great enthusiasm which was soon lost as these programmes failed. The principal reasons behind this were lack of political will, absence of presume from the poor peasants, apathetic attitude of the bureaucracy, absence of up-to-date land records etc. Some states like West Bengal and Kerala took steps to better the fate of the agriculture labourers by providing security of employment to them, ensuring prompt payment of wages to the workers and also by regulating the working hours. In the Eleventh Five Year Plan tenancy was legalised in a limited manner. It provided security to the tenant for the contractual period, which could be long enough to encourage long-term investment by the tenant. Again one of the main objective of the Twelfth Five Year Plan is to move Indian agriculture from a low productivity staple producing system to a rising productivity commercially oriented sector. This act was landmark legislation for land reforms in India. It provides for land acquisition as well as rehabilitation and resettlement. The main features of this Act a 1. A social impact assessment survey, preliminary notification stating the intent of acquisition, a declaration of acquisition and a fair compensation to the people affected by acquisition. 2. Compensation to be provided to the owners of the acquired land shall be four times in rural areas and twice in urban areas 3. In case of land acquisition for use by the private companies or public-private partnerships, consent of 80% people will be required. This act has ensured that people are paid a fair amount of compensation and rehabilitated when the government has acquired the land for public welfare and national prosperity. As we are in a phase of achieving sustainable economic development in the years to come, land and its contribution plays an active role in achieving this target. Since we are moving from an Agrarian economy towards an Industrial economy, the government needs to ensure the appropriate use of land to meet this gap Shortage of food supply in many areas and other land related problems which still exist tells us about unfinished agenda on land reforms. Land reform should include the people who will be affected by it. People should be the centre piece of any reform. The purpose of any reform will be positive if is strongly implemented. Land should not become a tool of politics or violence rather it should be a facilitator of growth and development. The main purpose land reforms is to help weaker section of society and do justice in land distribution that land should be allocated to the actual cultivator.",      
    "Topic62": "Tourism is the world's largest and fastest growing industry. It is an invisible export, which earns valuable foreign exchange without any significant or tangible loss of internal resources. Tourisms in India has immense potential of developing into a high profit making industry India is a popular tourist destination and has been successful in attracting domestic and international tourists. The picturesque landscape, hill stations, historical sites, architecture and monuments, beaches and enchanting backwaters, places of religious interests make India a preferred destination for the tourists from all over the world. The growth of tourism in India is evident from the fact that India has moved up six places to rank 34th on World Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index 2019, driven by rich natural and cultural resources and strong price competitiveness India showed the greatest percentage improvement to its overall Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score, which has helped it become the only lower middle income country in the top 35 Better connectivity of transport and communication, improved standard of living and value for money to the foreign tourists have led to the increase in the domestic as well as international tourists. The first Tourism Policy was announced by the Government of India in November, 1982. The aim of first tourism policy was to promote sustainable tourism as a means of economic growth and social integration. It was also to promote the image of India abroad as a country with glorious past, a vibrant present and a bright future. This policy revolved around six broad areas such as Swagur (welcome), Suchana (information). Suvidha (facilitation), Suraksha (safety), Sahyog (cooperation) and Sannachama (infrastructure development). The next major tourism policy was announced by the Government of India on 2002. The policy took into consideration one more key area, that is Safai (cleanliness) apart from other six areas mentioned in the first Tourism Policy, 1982. The government proposed to diversify the Indian tourism products and sustainability, improve the quality of tourism infrastructure, marketing, visa arrangements and air travel along with the policy. Incredible India Campaign was also launched to promote India as an attractive tourist destination by showcasing different aspects of Indian culture and history. The Government of India is taking keen interest in promoting the different form of tourism such as, 'rural tourism', 'eco-tourism', and 'spiritual tourism', 'spa tourism', and 'adventure tourism' etc. However, India still needs to enhance its enabling environment, tourist service infrastructure and environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech 15th August, 2019, made a strong pitch for domestic tourism and urged citizens visit atleast 15 destinations by 2022. The Government of India launched 'Swadesh Darshan' and 'National Mission' on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) in order to on boost tourism. The Swadesh Darshan focused on theme based tourist circuits and integrated infrastructure development. There are twelve circuits which have been indentified under this scheme for the development. These are Buddhist, Coastal, Desert, Eco, Himalayan, Krishna, North-East India, Ramayana, Rural, Spiritual, Tribal and Wildlife circuit. Under the PRASAD programme, 41 cities in 25 states have been identified for development of infrastructure. These cities are important pilgrimage sites and enjoy domestic well as international tourists throughout the year. The 'Incredible India' campaign by the Government of India is instrumental in promoting India as a holistic tourist destination in the domestic and international markets. There are specialised international media campaigns under 'Incredible India'. Celebrities have been roped in to make 'Incredible India' a success even in foreign lands. Besides, the 'Clean India' campaign under which cleanliness has become an indispensible norm at all the tourist destinations is also utilised to promote tourism. Swachh Iconic Place awards further promote the culture of cleanliness in archaeologically important tourist sites. Regular studies are being undertaken to analyse the market, identify the key factors, income figures, holiday habits and psyche of people in order to identify the key drivers in the tourism industry. The government has made the facility of e-Tourist Visa available to the citizens of 150 countries arriving at 16 designated international airports in India. The visa has a validity of 60 days and the procedures are much easier. The government has gone a step further to permit foreigners to visit India on an e-Tourist Visa for attending short term yoga programmes. This visa will be for the purpose of short duration medical treatment under Indian systems of medicine. This visa allows holders of Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter and start anywhere in India for 30 days. The Tourism Ministry has played an important role in the development of the tourism. The different functions of Ministry of Tourism are carried out by 'India Tourism Development Corporation' (ITDC). The Department of Tourism, Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management, National Council for Hotel Management and Catering Technology work towards the development of tourism in the country. ITDC hotels are situated at prime locations of important tourist destinations and provide comfortable and affordable boarding and lodging.  The Ministry of Tourism provides central financial assistance to the states, union territories and other Central agencies for the overall development of tourism in their area. The aim is to promote the culture and natural beauty of different regions and pilgrimage sites. The states at their level have been deploying measures to promote tourism. The Tourism Advisory Board recommends important measures for promotion of tourism. It reviews the tourist trends and suggests appropriate measures. Railway Ministry has also taken initiatives to promote tourism in India Indian Railway, Catering and Tourism Cooperation (IRCTC) is a wing of railway to promote tourism in India. The railways have offered many luxury tourist trains, semi-luxury tourist trains, Buddhist special trains, Bharat Darshan trains, Astha circuit trains, Palace on wheels and toy trains of Shimla and Darjeeling to attract domestic and international tourists. Many private companies like Make My Trip, Sterling Holidays, Club Mahindra etc, arrange domestic as well as foreign trips. The tourism industry has become one of the major contributors to the GDP of the country. It has the potential to generate mass employment and raise the income levels thereby contribute significantly to the economic development of the country. In the era of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation, the tourism industry in India has grown into a multibillion industry. It has led to significant improvement in the transportation and infrastructure facilities across the country. The allied sectors such as aviation, transport, horticulture and handicraft have been benefitted. The hotel industry is another allied industry of tourism which has vast potential to generate employment and help in earning foreign exchange Medical tourism has become an important source of revenue for the healthcare sector. Most of the foreigners from the Western countries such as United State United Kingdom, Canada, and neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan etc. are turning towards India for the affordable and world class healthcare services and treatment. Domestic tourism is growing and air connectivity has improved with regional connectivity scheme, but the government needs to adopt more holistic approach to support this sector. The concept of heritage hotels has gained popularity in India as the tourists get the experience of the exotic life style of a bygone era. Many historical havelis, castles, and forts built during the ancient times have been converted into heritage hotels. As expected, they have turned out to be major tourist attractions which also earn significant foreign incomes and raise the status of India as an excellent tourist destination. Tourism has played an important role in the revival of India's art and culture. The foreigners are fascinated by the rich culture and heritage of India. Seeing the keen interest of tourists in the rich culture and heritage of India, the government is taking steps to preserve it. The works of craftsmen and artisans are greatly appreciated and bought by the foreigners. This boosts their morale and adds to novelty. Regional tourism helps to maintain the cultural identity of the minority groups.",      
    "Topic63": "India has achieved excellent growth in its economy after the introduction of liberalisation reforms in early 1990s. These reforms have led to increase in GDP growth, stimulated industrial production in India, has put on curbs on fiscal deficit of the Central Government, and to large extent reduced poverty in India. On the other hand, this unprecedented growth has been accompanied by rising inequality of income and wealth in India. Inequality is defined as domination of a higher or wealthier class over less wealthy and weaker class. Though there cannot be perfect equality in any society but inequality shall not rise to such levels so that the fruits of the hard work of the poor people are not enjoyed only by the rich at the top. Rising inequality may affect the abilities of poor people. They may not invest in education, their health and other essential social services that have positive influence on their lives. It also affects the level of trust between the common citizens. Social capital gets restricted as people tend to maintain relations not beyond their own income group. The elite groups may also exclude the 'outsiders' from the economic opportunities they generate. Thus, income and wealth inequality tend to create several problems for the existing social-economic order in the country. Inequality has been rising in India sharply from the last three decades. The rich are getting richer at a faster rate whereas the poor are still struggling to earn even a minimum wage. According to Oxfam, an international organisation, the top 10% of people in India have 73% of total wealth of the country, whereas the bottom 50% of Indians which are almost 67 million in number have seen only 1% rise in their incomes. Between 2018 and 2022, India is estimated to produce 70 new millionaires every day. The number of billionaires has increased from 9 in 2000 to 119 in 2019. The wealth of all the billionaires of India is more than entire Union Budget of India for the year 2018-19. Due to high inequality, many ordinary Indian citizens are not able to access healthcare services that they need. 63 million Indians are pushed into poverty because of rising healthcare costs every year. This equals to almost 2 people per second. The extent of inequality is such that it would take almost 900 years for a minimum wage worker in rural India to earn what a top paid executive at a leading company in India would earn. Rising inequality in wealth is further aggravated by lack of essential services such as clean water, clean air, lack of education, health, sanitation etc. In India several factors are responsible for the existence of economic inequality within a society. These factors are (i) after the economic liberalisation, the wage rates are purely determined by markets. Inequalities are caused by differences in supply and demand of various kinds of works. The labour markets are inefficient in equal opportunities to everyone due to unequal competition, uneven distribution of providing information and inequalities in the level of education and capabilities. (ii) Abilities of People Differences in abilities such as intelligence, motivation, strength, etc. largely play an important role in determining individual's wealth Individuals with higher capabilities are able to work more efficiently as compared to people which are less capable. (iii) The level of tax rate in a system has a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society. If tax is progressively applied on the income, it tends reduce inequality whereas regressive taxes promote inequality. Thus, progressive taxation, coupled with good planning can lead to more equal societies and vice-versa. (iv) In creation of inequality sector of economy where there is high demand for higher education jobs, creates higher wages. But people with lower levels of education tend to fall behind lad of education leads to lower incomes as well as lower savings and investments in one's health, education etc. This creates a vicious cycle in which even the upcoming generations tend to be poor because of lower productivity and income of the existing generation. This phenomenon continues for generations. (v) Technological advancements such as new machines, robots, automation of processes, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks etc., seek to replace low level jobs. This reduces the demand for these jobs and reduces the incomes of the common workers. This also improves the efficiency of manufacturing and consequently more profits fr the elite class. This further leads to rise in inequalities. (vi) Neo-liberalism Economic neo-liberalism, coupled with deregulation by the governments has become one of the sources of income inequalities in India This has also led to reduced organisation of the labour class, which is exploited by the capitalists, thus inequality increases. (vii) Wealth condensation is a process by which a newly created wealth is concentrated in the possession of already wealthy individuals and entities. These people, who already have enough wealth, also find new avenues of wealth creation to raise their existing income levels. Thus, people who are already wealthy become wealthier. Inequality and its disproportionate rise have several harmful consequences for the society. Rising income inequality worsens the conditions of the poor labour class and people who are engaged in lower income generating employments such as agriculture and farming. This has following effects (i) there is distress migration from the poorer regions of the country towards the wealthier regions. Cities are flooded with migrant labour in India. This puts enormous pressure on the cities of India. The city infrastructure cannot bear such huge burden and often city governance collapses. Cities are filled with heaps dust, a poor drainage system, closed compact living spaces etc. due to rising income inequality. (ii) Increasing inequality also increases the burden on Government for providing subsidies for the poor. Various kinds of subsidies are provided by the government on food, fuel, free health services, education etc. to reduce inequality and redistribute wealth among the people. Thus, as inequality raises burden on government expenses raise (iii) Increase in inequality also leads to decreasing trust level among the citizen. This may also take the form of social unrests and civilian movements to demand special rights for e.g. OBCs demanding their rightful quota under the affirmative action policy of government. (iv) Increase in inequality of income also leads to rise in poverty levels and inter-generational inequalities. This forms a vicious cycle of rise in inequality and poverty that cannot be broken without intensive and disruptive interventions. (v) The pace of economic reforms is slowed down because of rising inequality. The previously successful reforms also start bearing fruits of inequalities and the national level gains in various social indicators are lost. (vi) Rising income inequality also deepens political inequality. Political power tends to concentrate in the hands of few wealthy. The poorer section is deprived of its right to participate in political processes and express their opinions. (vii) Overall it leads to deterioration in human capital of the country as due to lower incomes, the health, wealth and education of the poorer class is deteriorated. It leads to overall de-development of the country in real sense even though the economic growth may rise in numbers.  Inequalities of income may exist in any developing or developed economy. They may not get completely eliminated but it can be reduced. One step that can be taken in this direction is to fix minimum wages and enforce the laws on minimum wages strictly. The minimum wage should not just be calculated on paper but its effects on the lives of the people should be determined to ensure a decent and minimum standard to living Social security measures such as free and cheap education, cheaper health facilities, sickness compensation, schemes of social insurance etc. should be provided to the poorer class The taxation system should be so that who earns more should be taxed accordingly whereas those who earn less shall pay nominal taxes. There must be ceilings on large agricultural holdings, which may help in reducing inequalities in the rural areas of the country. The government should promote the agenda of more inclusive growth so that the economic growth and rise in GDP levels can be complemented by equal rise in the standard of living of the people. Labour reforms should also be started to ensure that labour productivity is not affected. Emphasis should be laid upon skilling of labour and skilling of school children so that they get ready to face the job market as soon as they complete their academic careers. The difference between haves and have nots should be reduced and domination of one class of people should be stopped. A more equal India would be a more prosperous India.",      
    "Topic64": "Black money is a term used for the funds earned through illegal activity and Black otherwise legal income that is not recorded for tax purposes. The illegitimate money may have been generated through illegitimate activities not permissible under the law, like crime, drug trade, terrorism and corruption, all of which are punishable under the legal framework of the state. Black money, often called unaccounted income or parallel economy has crippled Indian economy. Black money causes financial leakage as unreported income that is not taxed caused the government to lose revenue. It has led to deep penetration of the roots of corruption and led to the human greed. Apart from this, it leads to erosion of societal values of honesty, truthfulness, faith and fulfilment of one's duty. The web of black money overshadows transparency, accountability, efficiency and reliability. There have been several estimates regarding the extent of black money economy in India. A former CBI Director of India claimed that total black money in India is estimated around $500 billion. Although black money in India is a decades old problem, it has become real threat after the liberalisation era. Illegal activities such as crime and corruption, non-compliance with taxation requirements, complex procedural regulations, cultural and social practices, globalisation, weak institutional policy, legal and implementation structures have given rise to and sustained the black money economy. The criminal component of black money is build up by proceeds from trafficking in counterfeit and contraband goods, smuggling, illicit trade etc. The corrupt component of the black money nurtures from leakages from government social spending programs, black marketing of price controlled services etc. Black money is circulated, utilised and the profits earned are further invested in other sectors to generate further money. The black economy of India is sustained through various sectors. This includes the real estate sector which creates incentives for tax evasion through under-reporting of transactions in real estate. The bullion and jewellery sector gives the buyer an option of converting black money into gold and bullion, which can be evaded from the eyes of the tax authorities. Public procurement has grown phenomenally over the years in volume, scale m sty as well as complexity. The Competition Commission of India had estimated total public procurement figure for India at around 10 to 11 lakh crore per year which has provided ample scope of corruption due to rigged procurement process, generating black money. The Financial Action Task Force (FATE) highlights black economy prevalent in non-profit organisations where taxation laws that allow certain privileges and incentives for promoting charitable activities are minused and manipulated. Further, unregulated cash economy, tax havens, hawala transactions and offshore financial centres specialising in non-residential financial transactions all are prone to generating black money. Apart from this Trade-based Money Laundering (TML) also contributes to black money as it involves covering up the proceeds of crime and moving a certain amount of money through the use of male transactions in an attempt to legitimise their illegal origins.  The portion of country's income tied to black money affects the economic growth of the country. It also affects the investment pattern in the economy. Private investments are done mostly in the high end and luxury goods such as clubs, spa or bars, which results into shortage of funds for expenditure in social sector that includes health and education. There is huge loss of taxes amounting to billions to the exchequer. Black money leads to further corruption by creating a vicious cycle of circulation of the illegitimate money in the economy Investments that must have been made in the country giving the necessary boost to economy are invested elsewhere. It dilutes the policies of the RBI that targets inflation as RBI doesn't take into account the effects of black economy on the money supply in the economy. Forward trading of goods by speculators funded by black money came fluctuation in prices of various commodities due to hoarding It also threatens National security because black money is used to finance criminal activities. Black money generated from drugs and smuggling is used to operate terror networks. With an aim to curb the black money, the government has initiated Tax Reforms such as rationalisation of income tax to improve and widen the tax base and lower the effective taxes. Further, the government allows reporting black money generated through tax evasion in a given time frame by the Voluntary Disclosure Schemes. Also, to remove the existing unaccounted and illegitimate wealth from the economy, the government demonetised the currency in 2017. Cashless transactions are being encouraged by various incentives so that more transactions can be carried out by the formal banking systems. Legislative framework to fight with black money has been strengthened. This includes Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, Benami Transactions Produbition Act, 1988, Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 Institutions to deal with black money have been made more effective. Institutions such as Central Board of Direct Taxes, Enforcement Directorate, Financial Intelligence Unit, Central Board of Excise and Customs, Central Economic Intelligence Bureau and Other Central Agencies such as National Investigation Agency (NIA), Central Bureau of Investigation and Police Authorities have been given extensive powers to deal with the menace of black money. International cooperation has also been sought to deal with black money. Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters has been signed. India has always stood beside the principles laid down in the United Nations Convention against Corruption, United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances etc. Under pressure from India and other countries, Switzerland has made key changes in its local laws giving assistance to foreign nations in their pursuit of black money allegedly stored in Swiss Banks. These amendments, would allow India and other countries to make 'group requests for information about suspected black money hoarders which will make it easy for the Indian authorities to catch the hoarders. Various steps undertaken to fight black money shows mixed results and these are as follow (1) The government has been able to recover black money of 69,350 crore under the Income Declaration Scheme and Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act Another 5000 crore was recovered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). (2) Around 650 people declared money worth 4,100 crore deposited in foreign banks as the black money under Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets Act, 2015. (3) Demonitisation which declared 86% of currency notes all in 500 and 1000 denominations invalid in one go, is considered to be a failure by critics Around 16000 crore (out of 15.44 lakh crore) returned to banks, whereas RBI had to spend 21000 crore to carry out this massive exercise. (4) The amended Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act of 1988 in 2016 recorded provisional attachments in more than 1600 benami transactions involving benami properties valued at over 4300 crore. Despite all the efforts, the black money problem in India is still unresolved and lot more needs to be done to tackle it. There should be appropriate legislative framework related to Public Procurement, Prevention of Bribery of foreign officials, Citizens' Grievance Redressal, Whistle Blower Protection, UID Aadhar etc. Institutions dealing with illicit money shall be strengthened. Developing an Integrated Taxpayer Data Management System (ITDMS) and 360 degree profiling setting up of Cyber Forensic Labs and Work Stations will also be helpful. As elections are one of the biggest channels to utilise the black money, there should be appropriate reforms to reduce money power in elections. Black money severely affects the progress of a nation and generate economic and social imbalance. It is a fight that no government can fight alone. The people also must be cooperative and vigilant to fight against any kind of financial fraud or illegal activities.",      
    "Topic65": "Today India is one among the top ten industrial nations of the world. The Industrial development has changed India's economic status from underdeveloped to developing country. Industrial development today is considered as prerequisite for modern economic development. That is why all countries of the world, whether big or small, rich or poor and developed or developing are channelising their resources to promote rapid industrialisation. Before the rise of the modern industrial system, India had a flourishing state of cottage and household industries and Indian manufacturers had a worldwide market. Indian muslin, cotton and silk fabrics, calicoes, artistic wares etc. were in great demand all over the world. The real beginning of modern industries in India started with the establishment of cotton, textile industry at Mumbai in 1854. But post-independence witnessed a change in character and purpose of industrialisation. Identifying the need of a well-developed industrial sector, in 1951 India's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru announced that India had to become industrialised as fast as possible. The policy-makers did everything they could to improve the state of the manufacturing sector in India. Manufacturing sector is critical to Indian economy as it promises to provide gainful productive employment, shift of surplus agricultural labour to industries, reduce import bill and hence rationalise fiscal and current account deficit along with earning in export sector through promotion of Special Economic Zones. The industrial growth before 1991 can be categorised into three main periods. These are (1) Phase-I (1950-65) Major industries were sugar, cotton textiles, jute, iron and steel smelting, chemicals, petroleum, non-metallic mineral products, basic items etc. (2) Phase-II (1965-80) Major industries were basic goods, capital goods, high technology industries, ferrous metal, construction material and mechanical engineering industries. (3) Phase-III (1980-91) Major industries were consumer durables, export-oriented industries, modern technology based industries, petroleum products, non-electric machinery, food beverages etc. To realise the dream of development of industries, Indian Government adopted certain industrial resolutions and Five Year Plans. The First Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948 contemplated a mixed economy, reserving a sphere for the private sector and another for public sector. Then it was Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956 which laid down new classification of industries (Schedule A, Schedule B and Schedule C), fair and non-discriminatory treatment of private sector, encouragement of village and small industries removing regional disparities. This policy was based upon Mahalanobis model of growth which suggested that there should be an emphasis on the heavy industries and led the Indian economy to a higher growth rate. The 1956 Resolution was followed by Industrial Policy 1977, 1980 and the most important Industrial Policy of 1991. The 1991 policy envisages to culminate the gradual liberalisation since 1956 and unshackle the Indian economy from cobwebs of bureaucracy, introduce liberalisation, remove restriction on direct foreign investment and free the domestic entrepreneur from restrictions of Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practice (MRTP) Act. Indian economy hitherto a closed economy was opened to the forces and elements of globalisation. The abolition of industrial licensing, dismantling of price controls, dilution of reservation of small-scale industries and virtual abolition of monopoly law enabled Indian industry to blossom. Apart from industrial policy, the Five Year Plan devised by the Planning Commission also shaped industrial development in India. Though the First Five Year Plan was predominantly agricultural plan, industry was not totally neglected Hindustan Machine Tool, Integral Coach Factory, UP Government Cement Factory etc. were set up during the First Five Year Plan. The tempo of industrial development gathered momentum during Second Five Year Plan which adopted Mahalanobis Model with major industries like Rourkela Steel Plant, Bhilai Steel Plant etc. The subsequent plans also focused on industries but were without considerable success. It was the Eighth Five Year Plan which followed Industrial Policy Resolution 1991 and the popular reform liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation ignited the fire for the industrialisation in India which continued in all the subsequent plans. Small-scale industry is recognised by the Government of India as a priority sector as it paves way for rapid industrialisation. It is a prerequisite for balanced growth. is employment intensive and export earning Measures towards its development have been taken since First Five Year Plan and received special emphasis in Eleventh and Twelfth Five Year Plan. The Twelfth Five Year Plan envisaged capacity building, credit guarantee, launch of venture capital etc. for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). In 2015, the NDA Government announced Make in India scheme, a major national initiative designed to foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property and build best in-class manufacturing infrastructure. But Make in India cannot be sustained without encouragement to entrepreneurship, hence, Start-up India took birth. To encourage entrepreneurship amongst Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and women, Start-up India was launched which also promised additional boost to MSME sector and add to the MUDRA scheme for refinancing micro finance sector. The National Manufacturing Policy also envisaged developed National Investment and Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ) as integrated industrial townships with state of the art infrastructure and land use. Government has also provided a push to the khadi, village and coir industries by providing them with improved equipment, common facility centres, business development services, training, capacity building, design and marketing etc. under the Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) A Scheme for Promotion on Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE) aims to create new jobs, reduce unemployment, promote entrepreneurship culture in India, boost grassroots economic development at district level and facilitate innovative business solutions for unmet social needs. The credit linked subsidy scheme facilitates technology upgradation of small scale industries, by providing 15% upfront capital subsidy. It will help in upgrading plant and machinery of small enterprises with state of the art technology. The Credit Guarantee Scheme for micro and small enterprises also facilitates MSMEs by providing free credit facilities. Though industrialisation in India has come a long way from planning age to NITI Aayog (ensuring Cooperative Federalism), Revolutionary Industrial Policy, Manufacturing Policy, but still there is way ahead to go. The Economic Survey has categorised India as refuge of stability and outpost of opportunity. This stability and opportunity should be realised earliest to ensure Indian manufacturing sector shine brightly in the international domain. Education has to be linked with industry. (Vocational education) so that Indian youths are skilled, without which indigenisation of industry would remain a distant dream. The new mantra of industrialisation in 21st century should be to inculcate skills along with a hospitable and encouraging environment to improve ease of doing business in India. In the 21st century when science and technology have gained unquestionable supremacy, the level of the industrial development of a country has become an important factor to judge its actual development.",      
    "Topic66": "Growth of any country is dependent on the health of its industrial sector. The industries not only provide goods for internal consumption of the country but also for the exports Industries also offer employment opportunities for the young people of the country. The micro, small and medium enterprises plays important role both in manufacturing useful products for the country as well as generating employment for such a large population of India. The reach and extent of this sector is so large that it employs almost 11 crore people in the country and contributes to around 18% of GDP. These small units have enough potential to provide sustained growth for any economy. These enterprises also sustain the rural economy as many products are developed indigenously in rural areas. Due to low production costs and informal work environment, these industries can hold themselves up even during economic instabilities. If adequate infrastructural facilities are developed for them and these units are provided with latest technologies, skills, training and entrepreneurial calibre, they have the capability to give Indian economy a big leap forward and become pillars of growth. Definitions of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in India, the micro, small and medium enterprises in the service and manufacturing sector are classified on the basis of both investment in the plant and machinery as well as the turnover of the enterprise. Those enterprises where investment is not more than 1 crore and annual turnover is not more than 5 crores, are classified as micro enterprises. Those enterprises where investment is not more than 10 crore and annual turnover is not greater than 50 crore are classified as small enterprises. Those enterprises where investments are less than 50 crore and annual turnover is not more than 250 crores are classified as medium enterprises. According to this criteria, there are around 63 crore MSME units in India. The micro enterprises in the country account for 99% of MSMEs. The small and medium units only account for 0.52% and 0.01% of the estimated number of enterprises in India. MSMEs contribute to employment on a huge basis. This sector is second largest employment provider after the agriculture sector. The highest employment is in the trade sector followed by manufacturing. It accounts for nearly 33% of total manufacturing output per year and half of the country's exports. Thus, these units have the ability to make India self-reliant or atmanirbhar. The MSMEs play a major role in the socio-economic development of the country. This sector has registered higher growth rate as compared to other sectors but they face several challenges in the liberalisation era. These units have to continuously upgrade themselves to meet the emerging challenges. They face the following challenges. (i) The small industrial units are dependent on local sources of raw material. They have to purchase raw materials in smaller quantities and often on credit basis. They are not able to compete with large enterprises due to fragmented procurement of raw material because of lack of working capital. These industries have to pay higher prices for inputs and suffer uncertainty in procurement. Unlike the large industrial units, they are not able to take advantage of economies of scale due to bulk purchase. (ii) Scarcity of finance is a major obstacle in the development of small industries. The capital base of small enterprises is weaker and often they have to procure credit at a high rate of interest. Difficulties arise in formal loan documentation and lack of collateral. Lack of finance and credit affects their ability to expand their operations and ensure economies of scale. When economy is not maintained, it leads to high running costs and subsequent losses. (iii) Small industrial units are often deprives of infrastructure such as adequate power supply, transport and communication services. Lack of these necessary services results in slowing down of their growth and hinders their expansion Lack of these services also results in hindered development of ancillary and subsidiary industries. They are often not able to transport their manufactured products on time due to lack of efficient transportation. (iv) The small industrial MSM lack in trained and experienced managerial personnel. Most of the MSMEs do not have the capacity to hire trained and experienced managers. These MSMEs operate on the basis of local experiences and locally available personnel. Most of these are family enterprises which do not apply modern techniques of manufacturing and service delivery in their operations. (v) Access to adequate marketing facilities and opportunities becomes a major concern in terms of profitability of these enterprises. Though this sector produces a large volume of industrial output yet they are vulnerable to volatility in demands. There is no concept of advertising in this sector and links with national or international markets are quite weak. These enterprises operate locally as well as they procure their raw materials locally. The demands for higher standard products in the national and international markets are not fulfilled by these small enterprises due to marketing problems. (vi) The techniques of manufacturing and service delivery is MSME sector are obsolete. This has led to a condition where these units prod less at higher costs Technology is one of the most critical element in success and sustainability of these enterprises. If technology is not upgraded, these enterprises will loose their competitive edge in the international markets. The MSME sector is creating nearly 11 crore jobs across the country. This sector rightly known as India's engine of growth. Despite various constraints this sector has grown by over 8% over the years after being hit by the COVID 19. These smaller enterprises are very important for Indian economy. These encourage the growth of both rural as well as urban areas, the micro, medium and smaller enterprises in India generate employment for a large number of people. They also help in reducing the poverty rate. Rural urban gap is reduced by these MSMEs as most of the migrant labour is employed by the MSME sector. If local MSMEs are opened in the rural sectors, it may also lead to balanced economic growth between rural as well as urban areas. This can also help in reducing the large scale rural to urban migration. If MSME clusters are developed regionally, it would encourage regional development. MSMEs are major contributors to India's export sector. The share of MSMEs in the exports of India stands at almost 40% of the total exports. This also indicates the MSME products are being accepted globally. Thus, MSMEs help in boosting exports from India. MSMEs are also model industries for promoting inclusive growth in India as a large number of poor and low income groups spanning across classes, castes, gender, religion etc. are associated with the MSMEs. MSMEs increase the industrial and manufacturing capacity of India. It forms an essential component of the economy that can help in achieving self-sufficiency in manufacturing and service sector. MSMEs manufacture diverse range of products from clothing to automobile parts home appliances, cottage products such as honey, coir etc. as well as various ancillary components used in other industries. Thus, a large number of daily use components are provided by the MSME sector to the 1.3 billion Indian populations at lower costs. The service sector MSMEs cater to the needs of the large manufacturing base of India as well as international firms that have outsourced their work to Indian MSMEs in the service industry. If the MSME sector of India is protected from foreign competition as well as provided institutional support, it surely can become the engine of growth of the Indian economy and propel the economy to newer heights. The MSME sector, collectively, is much larger than the organised sector. To support the growth of MSMEs, the governments should earmark separate lands for the MSME sector which can be rented to them so that their running costs can be reduced. Registration and opening of MSMEs should be simplified so that it doesn't disincentivise the startups from opening businesses that have the potential to grow and compete with even the international businesses. The current credit gap in the MSME sector should be assessed and gaps should be filled by creating a specialised financial institution that could provide loans at cheaper rates to the MSMEs. The major detterent in getting credit is collateral. If collateral limits can be reduced, more credit could flow towards MSME sector. Availability of adequate long-term and working capital is necessary for the development of MSMEs. For improving access to infrastructure and ancillary services, the government shall setup innovation hubs (so that research and development facilities shall be promoted) and MSME clusters (so that better infrastructure can be made available to MSMEs). For improving the quality of MSME products, the State Governments should collaborate with MSME entrepreneurs and facilitate these industries with upgraded technologies. Marketing facilities can be developed with the help of a national portal that can enable the MSMEs in finding competitive deals through web interface. To facilitate international marketing, the Government must provide a comprehensive analysis on product wise export potential of various countries. There must be a systematic approach to support MSMEs through their life cycle as the level of support varies at various stages. MSMEs are backbone of Indian economy. This should be nurtured and made more competitive to integrate them with the global market supply chains.",

The banking sector reforms in India are aimed at introduction of best international practices and technological changes for making the Indian banking sector competitive globally. The Indian Banking System is more efficient and stable today. Consequently, they have been a rapid increase in the number of banks in country. The banking horizon is changing because of the increasing number of private banks and the foreign banks. Apparently there is a cut throat competition between the banks. Banks diversify their services as part of their corporate strategy to cater to various customer segments. The Indian Banking System is classified into scheduled and non-scheduled his Scheduled banks are those which are included in the Second Schedule of Banking Regulation Act, 1956 The Scheduled banks are then classified as State Cooperative Banks, and Commercial Banks The Non-scheduled banks are classified as Central Cooperative Banks and Primary credit societies and the Commercial Banks The origin of banks in India in modern sense dates back to 18th century, when the Bank of Hindustan was established. Banks in India have passed through different phases and have adopted itself to ever-changing economic conditions of the country. The largest and the oldest lank State Bank of India (SBI) came-into being in 1921 after the merger of Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay. SBI commands the largest number of banks in India along with a clutch of eight associated banks known as its subsidiary banks or associated banks. Reserve Bank of India is the Central Bank which looks after the monetary policy RBI in India's controls the supply of money in the economy. The major purpose d monetary policy is to check inflation and regulate interest rates with liquidity infusion or quantitative squeeze. Until recently, the lack of competitiveness vis-a-vis global standards, low technological level in operations, over staffing, high NPAs and low levels of motivation had shackled the performance of the banking industry. As the international standards became prevalent, banks had to unlearn their traditional operational methods of directed credit, directed investments and fixed interest rates, all of which led to deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios, inadequacy of capital and the erosion of profitability. Thus, banking sector reforms were needed to provide necessary platform for the Indian banks to operate on the basis of operational flexibility and functional autonomy, thereby enhancing efficiency, productivity and profitability. Further, the reforms help in enhancing the competitive element in the market through the entry of new banks. Reforms lead to increase in transparency of the bank's balance sheets through introduction of prudential norms and increase in the role of market forces due to the deregulated interest rates. Banking Sector Reforms in India Banking sector reforms undertaken in India are as follows 1. Reform before New Economic Policy (1991) - Nationalisation of Banks In the year 1969, government with banking companies (Acquisition and transfer of undertakings) ordinance nationalised 14 banks. The second nationalisation process of commercial banks took place in 1980s in which 6 more private banks were nationalised. The nationalisation process transitioned them from class banking to mass banking in this way. These banks were aligned with the fiscal policy of government. 2. Reforms after New Economic Policy - Liberalisation and Privatisation of Banks Another watershed reform in banking sector came in 1990s. In order to align with the new economic policy of government, the banking sector was liberalised. Licenses were given to private banks which changed the outlook of banking sector. Banks were now offering best practices available across the globe with the help of technology and management practices, ICICI, HDFC, Axis Banks were and still are pioneers in private sector banking. Setting Up of Committees on Banking Sector Reforms After the economic crisis of 1991, two committees under the chairmanship of M Narasimham were formed. It recommended wide ranging reform measures for the banking sector. The Indian banking system has witnessed a substantial improvement in both stability and efficiency parameters such as capital position, asset quality and overall profitability after adopting reform measures Various committees were set up even after that as well like Damodaran Committee, Khandelwal Committee, Nachiket Mor Committee and Urjit Patel Committee to bring the best practices and changes in banking sector. Mission Indradhanush In the wake of bringing new reform in the banking sector, Mission Indradhanush was launched in 2015. It is a 7-stage plan to address the challenges faced by Public Sector Banks (PSBs) many of the measures taken were suggested by PJ Nayak Committee on banking sector reforms. The 7 parts include appointments; banks board bureau, capitalisation, de-stressing, and empowerment, framework of accountability and governance reforms. The strategy, Indradhanush (Rainbow), focuses on systemic changes in state-run lenders, including a fresh look at hiring a comprehensive plan to de-stress bloated lenders, capital infusion and accountability incentives with higher rewards including stock options and cleaning up governance. Bank Board Bureau is set up to advise the banks on how to raise funds and how to go ahead with mergers, acquisitions and ways to address bad loans. The RBI introduced a framework of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) under which banks falling short of predetermined critical levels of capital adequacy, percentage of Non-Performing Assets (NPA) and return on assets would automatically trigger some mandatory corrective action and possibly also further non-mandatory actions RBI also decided to setup Public Credit Registry (PCR), an extensive database of credit information which is accessible to all stakeholders. This would breed transparency in bank credit culture. The Parliament passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 to streamline the resolution process of defaulting companies. The code helped in reducing the time taken for resolution of non-performing assets of banks. Setting up of MUDRA Banks another area with a promising future is Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) MUDRA Bank was unveiled by the government to provide credit to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME). A specialised bank for this sector will go a long way ensuring smooth flow of credit. On the other hand, small bank under differentiated license is expected to provide a whole suite of banking but in a limited area. The objective is to increase penetration of bank in the untouched areas. RBI has provided for Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) norms for this bank’s prudent operation. Though, major reforms have been undertaken to improve the condition of banking sector, a lot needs to be done to abate current and future risks that surround banking sector. Banking sector for the time is stressed mainly due to its rising NPA. The NPAs might rise further due to loans made under the government's flagship schemes like Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Kisan Credit Card Further, challenges like cyber-theft, banking frauds and decentralised currency (such as Bitcoins) pose a threat to banking sector which needs to be addressed. The NBFCs have caused credit crisis in the financial sector. Default in IL and FS bonds (Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services) sparked a liquidity crunch on other NBFCs. Having sound regulation for NBFCs, which is vital to India's overall growth, will help India's financial sector. The World Bank has suggested that India must undertake financial reforms three key areas (1) Sound regulations for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). (2) Allow private sector banks to expand in the banking sector. (3) Deepen capital market to aid growth. Financial sector is the mainstay of any economy and it contributes immensely in the mobilisation and distribution of resources. Financial sector reforms have long been viewed as significant part of the programme for policy reforms in a nation. The Banking Sector reforms have provided the economy with a lot of resilience and stability and have boomed nearly every sector of the economy. Now banks are playing significant role in resource mobilisation. Financial experts suggest that effective reforms keep an economy competitive and attractive from investors across the world. Openness to reforms and innovations and improvements in the government structure will allow for faster growth in banking sector.",      
    "Topic68": "Increasing Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and outstanding loans coupled with the problems of structural asset-liability mismatch and governance issues in management led to the need for structural remodelling in the banking sector. In this light, Central Government has initiated the process of reorganisation of banks in public sector. In 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman announced the merger of 10 Government of India undertaking banks into four mega-banks. After the merger, total number of public sector banks is set to become 12 from earlier 18. However, government's plan to recapitalise public sector banks could be hit badly as bad loans would increase and credit quality weaken because of the lockdown in the economy. It will depend upon the success of 20 lakh crore package to revive the economy. In India, the mergers of bank are not a new concept. In past, merger of banks have been undertaken so as to reform the banking system. The decision to merge the banks will not only fulfil the objectives of financial inclusion but will also result in better NPA and risk management. Further, the merger will reduce the dependence of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) on the government for capital since it will increase the role of internal and market resources. Merger is a process of bringing two or more separate business entities under common ownership through a series of legal and administrative measures. Usually the merger results into more competitiveness and provide economies of scale. Further, the wealth of a company, diversification of services and share in marketing also increased. Bank merger is a process in which previously distinct banks are consolidated into one institution. When a merger occurs, an independent bank loses its charter and becomes a part of an existing bank with a unified control. Modern banking system in India originated under the British rule. In the beginning of 19th century, British East India Company founded three banks - Bank of Bengal (1809), Bank of Bombay (1840) and Bank of Madras (1843). The three banks were merged in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which upon India's Independence, became State Bank of India in 1955. Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935. In 1969, the Indian government nationalised the 14 major private banks. In 1980, 6 more private banks were nationalised. The idea of bank merger first emerged in 1991 when former RBI Governor M Narasimham suggested the government to merge banks into a 3-tiered structure later mergers of Indian Banks were initiated following the recommendation of the Narasimham Commitee which was tasked with progress review of the implementation of the banking reforms. In 2014, the PJ Nayak Panel suggested that the government should either merge or privatise state owned banks. In 2017, five associates of State Bank of India and Bhartiya Mahila Bank were merged with SBI. This resulted in SBI being one amongst the 50 largest banks in the world. The government merged Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with Bank of Baroda, thus, creating third largest bank by loans in the country in 2018. With the announcement of mega merger in 2019, ten public sectors banks are set to become only four large banks. Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank will be merged together. Canara and Syndicate Bank are to be merged with each other. Merger of Union Bank of India, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank has also been announced. In addition to these mergers, Indian Bank and Allahabad Bank will also be merged. The Indian banking sector has been facing multiple challenges in recent past. The need for banking merger has arised due to the following reasons, Accumulation of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) have become a matter of grave concern for banking sector. It has impacted credit delivery of banks to a great extent. Twin balance sheet problem has further aggravated the deteriorating economic situation in India. Twin balance sheet problem refers to the stress on balance sheet of banks due to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) on one hand and heavily indebted corporates on the other hand. The ever increasing responsibility of PSBs in providing credit facilities to agriculture, capital intensive risky sectors such as steel, cement etc. and frequent loan waivers by government further deteriorates the credit culture in India. Political Interference in functioning of PSBs is a matter of grave concerns. It reduces the bank's efficiency. Other issues like long gestation period of projects, lack of timely environment clearance for projects, lack of thorough study of the business before disbursing loans and poor debt recovery architecture in the country also aggravate the problems of PSBs. These issues needs to be addressed through strengthening of the capital base of banks This can be achieved through mergers and acquisitions Merger of banks is e of the remedy for the ills of Indian Banking System. Bank consolidation procedures are governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 any two PSBs can initiate merger discussions However, the merger scheme is finalised by the government in consultation with RBI pending Parliament's approval. Parliament has the right to modify or reject the merger scheme Parliamentary approval is also necessary for merger of public sector bank and a private bank. The number of PSBs in India is high. These all banks usually cater the needs of customers belonging to similar domain and area. More often, this results in unnecessary and irrational competitive environment which ultimately affects the economy. India needs the merger of banks in order to become a global leader Bank mergers have following advantages (i) Mergers in banking sector will help in achieving the economies of scale and scope (ii) Merger of two weak banks with a strong bank will enable a faster and less costly way to improve the profitability. (iii) The consolidation of banks through merger will allow big banks to enter the global financial market and to survive in the high risk field of competition with foreign giants. (iv) As the size increases, the efficiency of the system is also set to increase and the large scale of operation will enable the banks to bring down the operative cost substantially. The merger might also pose some challenges. Some of the difficulties are as follows (i) Confusion and lack of clarity among employees. (ii) With considerable number of positions being abolished due to merger, there are chances of employees becoming jobless. With staff from participating banks coming together, there will be surplus staff at many branches. (iii) Integration of technology platforms and managing HR and cultural values of participating banks remains a critical issue. (iv) With the increase in the number of bank branches, it will be difficult for the head office of the merged entity to regulate and monitor all activities. Mergers are important for the consolidation and expansion purposes. They are also crucial for economy as they are most of the times successful in saving weak banks which fail in meeting expectations. There are few other measures by which banking system in India can be strengthened. The Union government on 24th June, 2020 approved to bring 1482 urban cooperative and 58 multi-state Cooperative Banks under the supervision of RBL However, merger also creates variety of problems which can cause great damage if the process of merger is not carried out cautiously. If merging is required, it must be carried out in a manner which leads to an environment of trust and agreement among the people of both the organisations. If people, work culture and vision are blended together nicely, merging will definitely have synergic effects and create a situation for all.",      
    "Topic69": "The 'Make in India' programme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25th September, 2014. The 'Make in India programme aims at promoting India as an important investment destination and a global hub for manufacturing design and innovation. The initiative not only target manufacturing sector alone, but also aims at promoting entrepreneurship in the country. India was the 9th largest recipient of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2019 according to World Investment Report 2020 by UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). Make in India seeks to encourage foreign investment that brings latest technology, expand knowledge base and inculcate research and development in the country. The government needs to motivate people to contribute their share to the 'Make in India' campaign. It is only with the collaborative efforts of the people and government that India can secure the title of a global manufacturing hub. In line with the programme, The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has announced on 23rd June, 2020 that the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal has made it mandatory for seller to submit the country of origin while registering any new product on the online procurement portal. This will complement the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme that has been started to push for locally made products. The 'Make in India' programme was a result of initiatives of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and is a collaborative effort of different departments and ministries. This was followed by national level workshops on sector specific industries in December, 2014. These workshops brought Government ministries and industry leaders together in order to draw an action plan that aimed at raising the contribution of manufacturing sector to 25% of the GDP by 2020. The resultant plan was presented to the Prime Minister, Union Ministers, industry leaders and associations The Public Private Partnership is the hallmark of the 'Make in India' campaign. In line with the Make in India, individual states launched their own local initiatives, such as 'Make in Odisha', Tamil Nadu Global investors meet, Vibrant Gujarat, Happening Haryana', 'Magnetic Maharashtra', 'Momentum Jharkhand Global Investor Summit. The 'Make in India' idea is not new. Factory production has a long history in the country. This initiative, however, set an ambitious goal of making India a global manufacturing hub. The three major objectives were: (a) To increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum. (b) To create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022. (c) To ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (revised to 2025) from the current 16%. The initiative is aimed at creating a conducive environment for investment, modern and efficient infrastructure, opening up new sectors for foreign investment and forging a partnership between government and industry through positive mindset. The initiative was simultaneously launched in all state capitals and in several Indian Embassies. It is a part of a wider set of nation building initiatives and aims to attract the top investors across the world to invest in India. 'Make in India' programme further aimed to reduce the level of unemployment faced by the youth of the country. The aim of launching this campaign in India is to make India a world level manufacturing powerhouse which will definitely help in solving some of the biggest issue of Indian economy. Other aim of 'Make in India' programme is to do away with red tapism i.e. delayed regulatory and procedural clearances. The government plans to give time bound clearances to the projects through a single online portal. This will create a conducive environment for the business besides the government is taking into consideration the skill mapping and manpower demand for specific sectors. This will ensure that right kind of training is given to people across the sectors in order to boost their employability. The 25 key sectors identified under the 'Make in India' initiative include automobile, automobile components, aviation, biotechnology, chemicals, construction, defence manufacturing, electrical machinery, electronic systems, food processing, IT and BPM, leather, media and entertainment, mining, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals ports and shipping, railways, renewable energy, roads and highways, space, textiles and garments, thermal power, tourism and hospitality, wellness The National Skill Development Authority (NSDA) is working on creating a Labour Market Information System. This will be helpful for the industry to source its manpower requirement for the Make in India campaign. The initiative has been highlighted at key international events. The Make in India programme was the key message on Brand India at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos (2015). The India Pavilion set up by the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) was inspired by Make in India programme. Make in India was also the theme for India's participation as partner country at Hannover Messe in Germany. The campaign aims to eliminate the hurdles and difficulties which have become synonymous with the country's business environment. The validity of the industrial license under the programme will be extended beyond 3 years. The FDI caps will be raised in a controlled manner. Recently, Indian government has opened up 100% FDI for telecom sector, for single brand retail. Exports done by manufacturing units help in lowering the trade deficit. The government also intends to develop industrial corridors and smart cities, create world class infrastructure with state of the art technology and high-speed communication. Better infrastructure will give a major push to the 'Make in India' initiative. Industry experts and analysts have given thumbs up to the 'Make in India' campaign. According to financial analysts, India's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has increased by 40% since the announcement of the programme. Companies like FOXCONN (manufacturer of i-Phones) etc., have all opened their manufacturing units in India. Fiat, Airbus and Hitachi are some other companies that have actively showed interest in the 'Make in India' initiative. There are a number of challenges that the government needs to overcome in order to make this programme a success in real term. India needs to be ready to tackle elements that adversely affect the competitiveness of manufacturing sector. Special tax concessions need to be given to the organisations and countries which are ready to set their establishments within the country. Although this will reduce the government's income earned through taxes, it will contribute a great deal in procuring foreign investment and technology to boost the campaign. A number of technology based companies have not shown enthusiasm for the campaign launch and hence preferred to continue to getting their components manufactured by China. Make in India campaign is at the loggerheads with the Make in China deal. It is major rival to India when it comes to the outsourcing, manufacturing and services business. Many economists and experts states that India rather needs to focus on Make for India since export-led growth strategy will not work for India as it did for Asia economies, including China. Therefore, the government should rather focus on creating an environment where all sort of enterprises can flourish and it is able to compete with rest of the world. This would encourage foreign producers to come and take advantage of our environment to create jobs in India Red tape corruption, poor infrastructure are another major areas of concern. The initiative has set out too ambitious growth rates for the manufacturing sector (12-14%). Historically, India has not achieved it and a quantum jump will be needed to achieve this goal. The major manufacturing economies of the world have reached the top positions by making factor costs more advantageous if the product were made in their countries rather than made elsewhere. Government need to focus on futuristic segments such as robotics, genomics, chemical feedstock etc. Making in a country must provide a competitive advantage to the manufacturer. For promoting Make in India and reducing import dependency, it is essential that developers in transmission, thermal, hydro, distribution and renewable sectors need to join the National campaign of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and wholeheartedly adopt the 'Make in India' policy of Government. Policy requirements and regulations at the Central, State and Local level need to be government's top priority. In conclusion, the 'Make in India' campaign acknowledges that no other sector does more to generate broad-scale economic growth and ultimately higher standard of living than manufacturing The Make in India programme has the potential to transform India into a manufacturing hub by creating conducive environment for ease of doing business, skill development, innovation and investment. Make in India is not a brand nor it is a slogan but it is a new national movement as it covers the whole spectrum of our government, society and business. As highlighted by our Prime Minister from rampants of Red Fort that skill, talent, discipline and determination of new India can help usher a 'New Industrial Revolution",      
    "Topic70": "Iron Man’s Jarvis and Star Wars’ C-3PO once seemed distant, the stuff of science fiction fanatics. But the growth of technology has been so rapid that it has often blurred the lines between fiction and reality. Back in 2020, people used an app called FaceApp for extremely realistic images of how they would look when they are old. FaceApp was, for most of us, among the first experiences into the power of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Since then, there have been many other tools that use AI, leaving us awestruck. One of these tools, which is getting widely popular, is ChatGPT by OpenAI. ChatGPT has multiple uses, from writing or fixing a code to getting suggestions, getting explanations, writing non-plagiarised essays, creating summaries of long write-ups, getting solutions to problems etc. The possibilities are still open to explorations as the beta version is available for users to try out. It especially gained popularity when students started realising that they can use ChatGPT to get through their homework assignments and projects by just letting this ‘assistant’ do it for them. Students around the world have been using it to complete their work and teachers have been reporting about how they doubt the credibility of the work being submitted to them. These developments are catching a lot of traction on the internet. There seems to be a lot of merit in the argument that ChatGPT and similar AI tools, in the near visible future, are going to change the way we live our lives. One of the major areas to be at the receiving end of this change will be education. The education sector needs to quickly catch up and adapt to the changing environment. The change that is looking at us in the eyes is that, with Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning-based tools, the skill of just knowing an answer is becoming increasingly less important. The factory-model school structure, where a teacher gives instructions to numerous students and teaches them to follow those instructions with efficiency, now seems an ancient setup. The skill of memorising information has been something we have stressed on for far too long in the way we teach and learn, but that focus will have to shift now. We have been teaching our students to be mere ‘rule followers’, people who follow instructions properly and get a task done efficiently. With AI, this skill runs the risk of turning irrelevant. We cannot compete with a machine when it comes to following instructions and carrying out a task with efficiency and accuracy. Creative thinking is where the focus needs to shift. We should be helping students form their own opinions and perceptions that are individualistic. An important skill is to learn how to ask the right questions or an inquiry-based approach. You must have noticed that while doing any research, an important aspect is to know what to search for, what to type into the Google search bar for the best fitting result. With AI, we still need to know what to ask the machine. We need to reflect if our education system is giving enough scope for this skill to be developed. Are schools equipped with a comfortable student-teacher ratio where each student gets a chance to ask questions and nurture their curiosity? Do we have enough infrastructure and budget allocation to ensure these setups? The culture of asking questions seems to be on the decline in our social fabric too, and that poses a major concern. Another skill that gives Human Intelligence an upper hand is our ability to adapt to change in circumstances. For example, simply applying tape on the wrong side of the road can cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into the wrong lane and crash. A human might not even register or react to the tape. This means that we need to focus on learning how to adapt and apply the learnt knowledge rather than finding a direct solution. We do see a shift in assessments with an emphasis on competency-based questions. With our national curriculum still shying away from allowing secondary school students to use calculators, we are not prepared to let our students be independent learners who are not just being trained to know the answer can create their own paths. The fear with technology was often that it would replace humans at multiple jobs and leave a huge working population helpless. However, we cannot deny how the rise in technology has also created a different set of jobs that works with and for technological development. Ignoring the inevitability of technology in our lives now is nearly impossible. AI might be doing a lot of work for us in the future, but we need to know that it is a tool that we use. We should be making ourselves and the future generations empowered to efficiently use these and also to be able to create similar technology. Another important role we need to play is to be able to correct the biases that data can create and uphold the ethics of any tool. An AI tool might not have the social-emotional context of all situations, which we need to keep enhancing. This discussion raises a deeper question: what makes us humans? The answer to this will be our strategy to remain relevant in a world full of AI. These human elements are what we need to focus on while designing our education plans for the future. Education cannot be just about gathering cognitive knowledge, but has to include the entanglement of our learnt knowledge with social, emotional and ethical implications. In an extremely competitive ecosystem with coaching centres creating a factory of ‘efficient computational machines’, our view about education and the purpose it serves has become extremely myopic. In conclusion, a checkpoint for AI in education — a location where we are prepared for ChatGPT and other such tools — seems quite far. However, we can make a start by humanising our concepts across all subjects. Remember, we are humans and should not try to transform into machines. Machines are definitely going to be better at that than us.",      
    "Topic71": "Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2023 is over. Someone should examine: Why such interest in the diaspora? A part of me wonders if this supposedly discrete group represents some kind of fantasy. Diaspora is at once an object of desire: Both wish-fulfilments to leave behind an apparently recalcitrant India for greener pastures, as well as a tether to roots that cannot seem to be severed. Diaspora can also be an object of renunciation. This is a less-commemorated affair. Here the logic goes that the diaspora is ‘our own’ only to the extent that they meet certain criteria. On the occasion that the resident Indian disagrees with the diaspora, the former transform themselves into the authentic native, while casting the latter off as an abject foreigner, too at a distance to weigh in on India’s domestic debates. In what amounts to a curious projection, it is the anglicised local who is most keen to levy this allegation. The diaspora, in their view, are guilty of romanticisation, or worse, of critique. ‘India welcomes those who further India’s pride across the globe,’ reads one street advertisement for the 2023 Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. Pride is apparently opposed to debate and not its corollary. Meanwhile, the local claims both the ostensible purity of the native as well as the conspicuous consumption of the foreigner. So in which diaspora do these ‘authentic Indians’ recognise themselves? Which will the government fête as its own? Growing up between India and North America, I have met a number of diaspora Indians. Some of them are exceptionally talented. Others wish to make money. Many have their own particular attachment to the subcontinent though, however hazy and phantasmagoric it may be. To them, ‘India’ can either be the remainder of what cannot be assimilated abroad or a card to play in the West’s identity politics. I say this about those outside India, but perhaps this diaspora is not much different from the well-to-do set ‘back home’. A home-grown diaspora, as it were. These people to live at a distance from a place called ‘India’, which they fetishise as infallible or denounce as irredeemable, an obstacle to more fruits of market liberalisation. They venture from Bombay as tourists to Banaras whose ‘folksy’ charm they find exotic or spiritually genteel. Like those abroad, the home-grown diaspora too represents a narrow slice of the pie and yet is imagined to speak for India writ large. And there is real pleasure in representing India, even from abroad. Perhaps especially so, for nowadays, it is the distance that seems to afford a chance to affirm India — a certain idea of India anyway, one that seems to have lost its hold inside the country. Maybe we all hold an ‘India’ at a distance in our heads. Who, after all, can claim intimacy with a country of this scale? Who can so confidently lay claim to mastering all its nooks and crannies? Maybe we are all in some ways Indian diaspora, for there is always an ‘India’ that is unknown, an India that is somehow out there somewhere, and not ready at hand. The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas has more clarity on these lofty issues. Its plenaries are concerned with the role of youth in innovation, healthcare, and cottage industries. The metaphysics of who constitutes the diaspora is here rendered into familiar, technical matters. The finance minister has remarked that remittances rose to about $100 billion in 2022. Definitions seem less urgent when there is the prospect of financial valuation. Besides, ‘inside’, ‘outside’ — isn’t it by now a truism to say that there are porous boundaries in today’s porous world? Maybe. But it is hard to keep the doors shut on some things while seeking to open them for others. I sympathise with the modern politician who is faced with this impossible task. ‘Pravasis are wearing foreign labels, drinking scotch, Russian vodka, eating Italian and Thai food. What is Make in India?,’ reads one comment on an article about the event. Pravasis have a long way to go should we wish they become only fit for purpose and never a thorn in one’s side. So, there is Pravasi Bharatiya Divas as an investment promotion exercise, and there is Pravasi Bharatiya Divas as a rhetorical exercise. There was no shortage of pomp and flourish around the event. The diaspora is reminded of their importance to India’s future. All this at a time when we read that Indians are leaving the country in greater numbers. And that the OCI scheme is being downgraded. The more India is looking to become a great power on the world stage, the more some of its ability to do so seems to be draining from within. It may be that the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas seeks to paper over this contradiction: Things are okay, we are reassured, for the diaspora too will have their ghar wapasi. But as we wait for the second coming of the NRI, whither India? We read in the papers of a churn in the country. There is a churn going on in the diaspora too. Those born abroad had earlier narrowed their heritage to Bollywood, samosas, and university bhangra groups. Now they look to India with fresh eyes. We come from a Subcontinent with a rich and checkered history, they tell me. And we cherish its diversity, hoping it remains vibrant. Many of us who have grown up outside of India wish only the best for its people and its government. We perceive our own fate as bound up with that of the country. There is a hold India has in its absence whose call can be moving. I’ll admit there’s a touch of romance here — please allow me this, for it eases the sight of bearing witness to India when it doesn’t prosper. Yes, there is a new diaspora in the offing. Whether it will be welcome at the next Pravasi Bharatiya Divas remains to be seen.",      
    "Topic72": "Japan has long been viewed as a passive member of the Global North. Its only apparent contribution was to lend an ‘Asian colour’ to the predominantly Caucasian G7 forum. The colour of the G7, of course, has been changing thanks to the likes of Barack Obama and Rishi Sunak who have risen to the top of the political heap in the democratic societies of the North. But this column is not about the changing racial character of the G7 chancelleries. Its focus is on Japan’s impressive recent leadership in the world of strategic ideas. It is Tokyo, for example, that has constructed and popularised the Indo-Pacific construct over the last decade and more. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe first articulated the idea of the Indo-Pacific in an address to the Indian Parliament in August 2007. That speech had called for a coalition of Asian democracies that eventually took the form of the Quadrilateral forum. While most countries, including India and the US, hummed and hawed about the Indo-Pacific, it was Tokyo’s persistence that helped the emergence of the Indo-Pacific as integral to the geopolitics of Asia. Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has now taken the initiative to raise the Global south — an omnibus term for the developing or the so-called Third World — to the top of the G7 agenda. When Delhi resurrected the idea of ‘Global South’ last year in the run-up to its presidency of the G20, there was widespread scepticism as well as concern. The sceptics said there is no such thing as the Global South any more. After all, there is enormous economic differentiation within the Third World today and many developing nations have become developed. Others wondered if Delhi was going back to its Cold War trade unionism — mobilising the Global South against the North. But Japan’s adoption of the case for urgent engagement of the Global South lends much-needed nuance to the debate. It also boosts Delhi’s diplomacy on the Global South, which is not about returning to the past but reconnecting to long-neglected global constituencies in a new framework and context. In a major policy speech at the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington last month, Japan’s PM Kishida cautioned other G7 countries on the dangers of neglecting the Global South. Kishida’s emphasis on engaging the Global South will hopefully rub off on other developed nations. Japan is hosting this year’s G7 summit at Hiroshima, Kishida’s hometown, in mid-May. With India wanting to make the voice of the Global South heard at this year’s G20 summit, there is much new room for global political collaboration between Delhi and Tokyo.  Japan’s new emphasis on the Global South comes amidst a major transformation of its foreign and security policies under Kishida’s leadership. Kishida is among the few leaders in Asia who has clearly articulated the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago this month. ‘If we let this unilateral change of the status quo by force go unchallenged’, Kishida said, ‘it will happen elsewhere in the world, including Asia.’ Having been at the receiving end of Chinese bullying on its maritime frontier, Japan has few problems in seeing the implications of the Russian action in Ukraine for Asia. The Ukraine war, coming on top of the long-standing threats from North Korea and mounting security challenges from China, has pushed Kishida towards sweeping reform of Japan’s defence policy. This involved doubling the defence spending to 2 per cent of the GDP over the next 5 years, building a large missile force or ‘counter strike capability’, boosting cybersecurity capabilities, and taking larger responsibilities for regional security including arms transfers and capacity building in the Indo-Pacific. The war in Ukraine has helped a pacifist Japan recognise the essential relationship between diplomacy and defence. As Kishida put it, ‘diplomacy needs to be backed by defence capabilities and reinforcing defence capabilities will also lead to persuasiveness in carrying out our diplomatic efforts’. This new pragmatism is rooted in what Kishida calls Japan’s new ‘realist diplomacy’. Realism is also at the heart of Kishida’s approach to the Global South. He confronts head-on the idea so deeply held in the West that it must strive to promote democracy around the world. Speaking in the heart of Washington’s beltway, Kishida pointed out that contrary to the belief in the era of globalisation, the world is not heading towards a converging set of values. Kishida is firm in his conviction the G7 can’t ‘impose its values’ on the Global South. Instead, Kishida tells his G7 partners: ‘We need to be more committed to our values. At the same time, when engaging with the Global South, we need to remain humble while putting aside preconceptions and have a firm understanding of their respective historical and cultural backgrounds.’ He alerted them: ‘Even if we walk on a path which we believe to be right, if the Global South — holding integral places in the international arena — turn their back, we will find ourselves in the minority and unable to resolve mounting policy issues.’ Kishida is reflecting on the fact that many developing nations were not willing to join the Western condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite the fact that the Global South deeply values the ideas of territorial sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of states. He is acutely conscious of the fact that the West has neglected political engagement with the Global South in recent decades. In the Cold War, the West competed fiercely with Moscow for strategic influence across the Global South. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the G7 simply took the Global South for granted and was more interested in lecturing rather than talking to the leaders of the Global South. This, in turn, left much room for China and Russia to play in the developing world. Japan now wants the G7 to reconnect with the Global South in more fundamental ways. Kishida believes greater cooperation between the G7 and the developing countries is also critical for addressing the current global challenges. Well before the Global South became an important area of Indian and Japanese diplomacy, the two sides had agreed to deepen regional cooperation across the Indo-Pacific. Kishida’s new approach provides the basis for more substantive and wider collaboration between Delhi and Tokyo in the developing regions of the world. India, which has long backed Japan’s leadership role in Asia, has every reason to welcome Kishida’s new interest in the Global South. Japan’s initiatives on the Indo-Pacific and the Quad have broken the misperception of Asia as being merely Sino-centric. The India-Japan partnership on the Global South might hopefully help overcome the traditional divides between East and West as well as North and South.",      
    "Topic73": "The war in Ukraine, which began a year ago this month, is accelerating the breakdown of familiar geopolitical antinomies, such as Europe and Asia. Nothing illustrates the new landscape more powerfully than South Korea’s emergence as a major supplier of arms to Europe, which is at war with itself. Korea’s rise in the European theatre highlights two important new strategic trends. One, Asia has long ceased to be a passive theatre for rivalry among the Western powers. We are now beginning to see Asian powers contribute to European security. No wonder, the trans-Atlantic military alliance NATO is stepping up its engagement with Asian powers. China, which churned out so much propaganda about India joining an ‘Asian NATO’ for nearly a decade-and-a-half, now has something real to chew on. Two of Beijing’s most important neighbours and economic partners — South Korea and Japan — are not only bringing NATO into Asia, but also taking Asia to NATO’s frontlines with Russia. Second, the idea that Europe and Asia are separate strategic theatres is becoming difficult to sustain. China’s alliance ‘without limits’ unveiled last year with Russia has broken through that mental block. The US has, in turn, responded by promoting greater cooperation between NATO and America’s Asian allies. NATO’s Madrid summit last June, which took place in the aftermath of Russia’s Ukraine invasion, saw the participation for the first time of Asian leaders from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Last week, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg followed up the initiative by travelling to Seoul and Tokyo. His main message was simple: European and Asian security are deeply interconnected. And that NATO and Asia can help each other in dealing with the dangers from Russia and China. In Seoul, he was pressing the South Korean leaders to start supplying arms directly to Ukraine. Right now South Korean arms are making their way to Ukraine through third countries or replenishing the arsenals of those sending their weapons to Kyiv. Domestic political opposition from the left and warnings from Moscow have made Seoul rather cautious about direct arms sales to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Korean arms sales to Europe are surging. Poland alone is expected to bury nearly $16 billion worth of arms from South Korea. Among the equipment to be supplied include tanks, howitzers, and fighter aircraft. Poland is not the only one that is looking to South Korea; Norway and Estonia are among other European states looking to Seoul to cope with the perceived security threats from Russia. Korea is not the only one wading into the European arms bazaar. Locked in a grinding war that will turn one year old this month, Ukraine and Russia are running through arms and ammunition at a phenomenal rate. Moscow’s neighbours to the West, which have long memories of Russian expansionism, are also arming themselves with new weapons. The Western and Russian arms industries are not geared to cope with the massive demand. Our Western neighbour Pakistan is transferring ammunition to Ukraine as part of a major diplomatic effort to reset relations with the US that frayed badly under Imran Khan’s tenure. If the former PM seemed ready to back the Sino-Russian alliance, the current government is trying to correct that tilt. Seoul’s sibling Pyongyang has joined the party — on the other side. Russia has turned to North Korea for the supply of winter clothing and ammunition. Iran has become a major supplier of drones to Russia. Turkey has supplied drones and more to Ukraine over the last year. Turkey has also been in the lead in trying to create diplomatic engagement between Ukraine and Russia. A traditional trope in Asian discourse has been the idea that the great Western military-industrial complex manipulates poor innocent developing countries into spending their scarce resources on buying arms. The source of the problem was not just the ‘greed’ of the Western ‘merchants of death’.  As power struggles within and between the developing countries in the non-Western world turned violent and generated the demand for weapons in the post-colonial era, Western merchants provided the supplies. But the arms bazaar is no longer exclusively Western. Asian powers are now important producers and traders of weapons. China is the fourth largest arms exporter in the world after the US, Russia, and France. Most of China’s arms exports are to the developing world and have yet to penetrate the developed markets. With many European countries passing laws not to sell arms to conflict zones, the demand for Asian weapons has only grown. Korea, whose arms exports reached nearly $20 billion last year, is now ranked eighth on the list of arms exporters. Buoyed by the surge in the demand for its arms sales, Korea wants to quickly climb up the list. The capacity to deliver high-quality weapons at low cost and on short order has put Korea in a pivotal position. India too is eager to export arms and there has been some progress in recent months. The export of Brahmos to the Philippines last year has been a major milestone in the country’s evolution as an arms producer. The largest destination for Indian arms exports is not the developing world, but the US. That has largely come from the Indian supply sub-assemblies to US weapons systems. When it comes to selling in the markets of the Global South, India is struggling to fend off competition from the better-organised and more developed South Korean manufacturers. There has been much media speculation that India’s HAL has been close to clinching the contracts in Malaysia and Egypt for its Tejas fighters. In both places, the fighter and trainer aircraft built by Korea Aircraft Industries won the competition. Russia’s war in Ukraine has also woken up the world’s third-largest economy, Japan, to rethink its security policies. Selling arms to friends and partners is among the many outcomes of Japan’s recent radical overhaul of its national defence policy. Although it had a powerful arms industry of its own that made a great impact during the Second World War, post-war pacifism bottled up its arms makers. Japan has provided some non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine; it might be a while before Tokyo becomes a major arms exporter like South Korea. But Japan is preparing to boost its weapons sales over the longer term. Tokyo plans to double defence spending over the next five years. Japan is also tying up with European and American arms companies to develop fighter aircraft, missiles and drones for domestic use as well as exports. For India, which is coping with the Chinese military challenge on its borders as well as in its waters as well as reducing its dependence on Russian weapons, the new and dynamic defence engagement between Europe and Asia opens up multiple opportunities. This includes the possibilities for modernising its rusty defence industrial base in partnership with friendly states. India’s recent agreement with the US on expanding joint defence production and technology should be a precursor to a wider range of agreements with its European and Asian partners to transform India’s defence production and enhance its arms exports.",      
    "Topic74": "The triangular dynamic between the US, Russia and China has long been the principal factor shaping independent India’s geopolitics. The unveiling of a new Sino-Russian alliance a year ago this week, the Russian aggression towards Ukraine, and the deepening confrontation between the West and Russia and China are compelling India to recalibrate its international relations. Last February, Vladimir Putin travelled to Beijing to unveil a partnership ‘without limits’ and with no ‘forbidden areas’. To be sure, Russia and China had a strategic partnership for a long time before Putin’s February 2022 visit. What the Beijing declaration did was lay out a solid basis for jointly confronting the West. Until the turn of the 2010s, both Moscow and Beijing sought a productive relationship with the US. Russia’s accumulating grievances against the West and China’s new ambition to replace the US as Asia’s dominant power have brought them much closer now. A few days after issuing the declaration on February 4, Putin invaded Ukraine. We do not know the nature of the consultations, if any, on Ukraine when Putin and Xi Jinping met in Beijing. It is not unreasonable to presume that the Sino-Russian alliance added to Moscow’s confidence in risking a confrontation with the West in Europe. Putin had hoped that his multi-pronged military offensive would force a quick collapse of the regime in Kyiv and fold Ukraine’s sovereignty into Russia’s. Imagine for a moment he had gotten away with this in Ukraine. Putin, who had long complained about the European security order, would have driven a stake through its heart. A quick, decisive and successful use of force in Ukraine would have deeply divided Europe and fractured the US-led trans-Atlantic security system that dominated the region for more than seven decades. Coming less than a year after the ignominious US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Moscow’s absorption of Ukraine would have further undermined the credibility of the US as a global power. Putin’s victory in Europe would have had a dramatic impact on Asia too. It would have reinforced the sentiment that America is in terminal decline, weakened US alliances in Asia, and boosted China’s ambition to radically reshape its periphery. If Putin had successfully conquered Ukraine, Xi’s path to unification with Taiwan through the use of force or mere coercive diplomacy might have eased. But the Sino-Russian project of building a post-Western global order went awry in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s defiant courage prevented the quick collapse of the regime in Kyiv and that, in turn, helped mobilise massive military assistance from the Western world. Nearly a year after the invasion, Putin is locked in a grinding stalemate. He has lost nearly 50 per cent of the territory Russia gained in eastern Ukraine during the early phase of the invasion. Russia’s military material and manpower losses have been immense and Moscow faces a harsh regime of Western economic sanctions. Where does this leave the Sino-Russian alliance and what are its implications for India? Several preliminary assessments can be laid out. First, instead of delivering a final blow to the US primacy in the international system, Putin and Xi have facilitated the resurrection of Western unity under American leadership. The Ukraine invasion has also allowed the US to put simultaneous pressure on both China and Russia. In Europe, Putin’s war has helped the US galvanise and expand NATO. The Russian invasion has also triggered the fear of Chinese territorial expansionism in Asia. This has led to the strengthening of US bilateral alliances with Australia and Japan. Washington has significantly raised its military and political support for Taipei and is making it harder for Xi to embark on an invasion of Taiwan. Second, the Sino-Russian alliance and the Ukraine war have seen two reluctant and pacifist powers — Germany and Japan — join the battle against Moscow and Beijing. Japan and Germany happen to be the world’s third and fourth largest economies and their mobilisation significantly alters the so-called ‘correlation of forces’ between the West and the Moscow-Beijing axis. Both Berlin and Tokyo are now committed to raising their defence spending to cope with the security challenges from Moscow and Beijing. Despite their huge stakes in economic engagement with Russia and China, Berlin and Tokyo have had no choice but to join Washington in ramping up the commercial pressure against Russia and China. Third, if Russia and China thought they could dominate Eurasia through an alliance, Washington is doing something similar to bring its alliances and partnerships in Europe and Asia closer. We saw the leaders of America’s Asian allies join for the first time a NATO summit last June in Madrid. NATO, in turn, has promised to take a greater interest in shaping the Indo-Pacific balance of power. Fourth, while the jury is out on the future of the Sino-Russian alliance, there is a growing prospect that Moscow will become more beholden to Beijing after Putin’s military misadventure in Ukraine. The poor Russian strategic performance may have diminished Putin’s standing with Xi and complicated China’s plans, but Beijing is unlikely to abandon Moscow. A weakened Putin will remain a valuable asset for Xi even as Beijing seeks to blunt some of the new Western hostility to China. Finally, India’s discomfort in the messy menage a trios with Russia and China will only grow. The Sino-Russian alliance puts India in a terrible predicament: China can ramp up, at will, the military pressure on the disputed border with India; Delhi depends on Russian military supplies to cope with the PLA challenge; and Moscow is now a junior partner to Beijing. This is certainly not a nice place for Delhi to be in. To make matters worse, the dependence on Russian arms has severely constrained India’s position on Ukraine and cast a shadow over Delhi’s engagement with Europe and the US. If the Russian partnership was long seen as the key to India’s ‘strategic autonomy’, Delhi’s arms dependence on Moscow is now the biggest constraint on India’s freedom of action. Nearly three decades ago, India turned to Russia and China to promote a multipolar world amidst a unipolar moment dominated by the US. As it faced the prospect of a unipolar Asia dominated by a rising and assertive China, Delhi has turned to the US and its allies to restore the regional balance of power. The transition, however, has at once become more urgent and complicated by the new Sino-Russian alliance and President Putin’s war against Ukraine.",      
    "Topic75": "On India’s 75th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the National Hydrogen Mission to make the country a production and export hub of green hydrogen. This mission was approved by the Union Cabinet on January 4, 2023 with an initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore ($2.3 billion) over the next five years, aimed at producing 5 MMT (million metric tonne) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW (giga watt) by 2030. While the green hydrogen dream seems appealing, critical challenges must be examined to help design appropriate pathways to realise this vision. Hydrogen is produced through water electrolysis, something most of us would have learnt in our science textbooks in school. When the electricity used in the water electrolysis is produced from renewables, it is termed as green hydrogen. Sustainability experts have ascribed an entire colour spectrum to hydrogen — green, blue, grey, black, and brown depending on their ability to totally avoid or capture the greenhouse gases produced in the process of making hydrogen. However, our focus is on green hydrogen as it has the potential to maximise decarbonisation of the energy sector and the use of energy in end-use sectors such as transport, buildings and industry. While the stated benefits of the National Mission are galore — savings to the tune of $12.5 billion from fuel imports, averting 50 MMTs of annual emissions of Carbon dioxide, fresh investments to the tune of $100 billion, and 6,00,000 green jobs, there are several challenges too. The challenges to produce and use green hydrogen can be classified into 4Es — electrolyser, energy source, end use and endogenous resources. We will delve into each one of them in this article. Electrolyser challenge: According to IEA (International Energy Agency), as of 2021 the global manufacturing capacity of electrolysers stands at 8 GW/year. So, if India were to achieve its 2030 target, it would need anywhere from 60-100 GW of electrolyser capacity, which means almost 12 times the current global production capacity. India currently has launched projects to manufacture electrolysers, but the actual numbers as of today are negligible. Also access to critical minerals such as nickel, platinum group metals and rare earth metals such as lanthanum, yttrium and zirconium could hinder scaling up electrolyser manufacturing capability in India. These resources are concentrated in countries such as China, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, Chile and Peru. India also has limited processing capabilities in these minerals. This challenge would entail India setting up largescale manufacturing, building expertise and securing geo-political partnerships for procurement of critical minerals, and improving overall technical and economic viability of electrolysers year-over-year while competing with other global players. Energy source challenge: As per current estimates a completely efficient electrolysis system would require 39 kWh of electricity to produce 1 kg of hydrogen. This is, however, a laboratory tested figure and a typical operational figure is about 48 kWh per kg of hydrogen. Green hydrogen requires renewable energy as a source of electricity. India currently estimates a capacity of 125 GW of renewable energy to meet its green hydrogen 2030 targets, which would be in addition to the already proposed targets of 500 GW renewables energy capacity. So far India has only achieved 119 GW of the 175 GW targeted capacity using solar, wind, bio-power and small hydro. In addition to the generation capacity, the transmission capacity that includes a smooth facilitation of cross-border exchange of power between states is a critical requirement. Overall, this challenge would require India to add efficiently and economically close to 100 GW of overall renewable energy capacity per year over the next seven years and make available dispatch corridors and mechanisms. End use challenge: Currently, most of the demand for hydrogen comes from the chemical industry to produce ammonia for fertilisers, followed by refining for hydrocracking and the desulphurisation of fuels. It can be a source of heat for industry, especially in hard to abate and electrify sectors such as steel, cement and aluminium production. In the transport sector, it can be used as fuel for heavy duty vehicles, aviation and shipping. The conversion efficiency from one form of energy carrier to another in the end use application will determine the scale of green hydrogen’s applicability. For instance, where electricity can directly serve the purpose, having alternative energy carriers for the same use case would not make technical or economic sense. Hydrogen is a highly combustible and volatile element and its potency in other forms such as ammonia or methanol is only relatively reduced. If one were to look at green hydrogen being produced and stored in different forms for later use, it is critical to establish safety standards for storage and transportation, adding to the cost of hydrogen as a fuel. Endogenous resources challenge: It has been estimated that the production of one kg of hydrogen by electrolysis requires around nine litres of water. Moreover, in the case of India, an independent assessment suggests a requirement of approximately 50 billion litres of demineralised water supply. As several parts of India are already severely water-stressed, solutions need to be found to cater to this additional water demand. While desalination has been suggested, this will not only increase the physical footprint of the required infrastructure, but also potentially add to competition for land use, impact biodiversity and create challenges and limitations in the location of electrolysers. This challenge would require the proposed green hydrogen hubs to strike a fine balance between being renewable energy rich, water resource rich and being close to hydrogen demand (end-use) centres for them to be economically feasible while keeping the additional costs minimum. In 2020, the world produced around 90MMT of hydrogen. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that hydrogen and its derivatives will account for 12 per cent of global final energy consumption by 2050 (IEA estimate 530MMT), with two-thirds coming from green hydrogen. Currently, the global levelised cost of producing green hydrogen ranges between Rs 250-650/kg ($ 3-8/kg) while India aims to produce green hydrogen in the range of Rs 100-150/kg ($ 1-2/kg) by 2030. This would mean India will have to address all the challenges listed above as well as coordinate across multiple institutional bodies both public and private in record time. This is undoubtedly a steep uphill task but a moonshot worth undertaking for India!",      
    "Topic76": "February 1, 2023, marked two years since the military in Myanmar attempted to stage a coup. Since then, the country has seen intense civil strife, widespread violence against civilians and an organised wave of resistance against the junta. This is a good time to recall that even before the coup, the Tatmadaw was targeting civilian populations — ethnic minorities in particular — and using disproportionate force. One of the worst-hit victims of their brutality was the Rohingya Muslim community, residing in the north of the Rakhine State in western Myanmar. In 2016 and 2017, the military, under the garb of conducting ‘clearance operations’, targeted the minority community using extraordinary levels of violence. Some 8,00,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar and took refuge in the neighbouring country, Bangladesh. In 2018, a report published by a UN fact-finding team concluded that the military campaigns had ‘genocidal intent’. This is the same military that claims to legitimately rule the country today. Initially, life in the refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh provided a semblance of security and stability to the Rohingya. Along with a roof over their heads, these camps provided them with an opportunity to share, with the world, stories of the horrors they’ve faced. Conditions in the camps, which currently host about a million refugees, have deteriorated. From rising poverty due to a lack of employment opportunities, to the constant threat of violence by criminal gangs and armed groups, the Rohingya continue to face multi-faceted threats in these camps. Rising complaints by the host population of supposed resource degradation and social instability have driven the Sheikh Hasina government to ship off some 30,000 of the refugees to Bhashan Char, a remote, offshore island formed by silt deposition. That the camps in Bangladesh are turning into hostile territory for the Rohingya, much like their enclosed villages and IDP camps in Myanmar, is shown by a steady uptick in refugee crossings through the Andaman Sea. In 2022, hundreds of them took to the sea from Bangladesh and Myanmar on boats arranged by smugglers in search of a better life in Southeast Asia. However, many of them found themselves in the maws of death in the middle of the high seas when their rickety vessels gave up halfway through. In December 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees announced that one of the boats with around 180 refugees had fallen off the radar and everyone on board was presumed dead. Days later, more than 200 Rohingya washed up ashore on a beach in northwestern Indonesia’s Aceh Province in two separate boats. On January 8, another boat with 184 refugees washed up in Aceh. This isn’t the first time the Rohingya are taking to the sea to reach Southeast Asia. In the first half of 2015, some 30,000 attempted to make this dangerous voyage from Bangladesh and Myanmar. The numbers dipped sharply in the following years until they began climbing again in 2021. According to the UN refugee agency, 2022 saw a more than six-fold increase in a year in Rohingya refugee crossings across the Andaman Sea. In terms of the dead and the missing, too, 2022 was one of the worst years in recent memory. What’s particularly striking, and rather disturbing, is the absolute lack of response from any of the countries in the region to this recurrent humanitarian tragedy. Despite the UNHCR, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), and several Rohingya activists publicly releasing detailed information about the distressed, non-seaworthy vessels and issuing categorical calls for their rescue, no country or national maritime force in the Bay of Bengal littoral region has made any attempt to proactively look for or rescue the refugees. The only exception was the Sri Lankan Navy, which rescued some 105 Rohingya from the country’s northern shores on December 18, 2022. After the 2015 crossings when hundreds perished at sea, countries part of the ‘Bali Process’, a 49-member grouping formed in 2002, met in the Indonesian province and signed the 2016 Bali Declaration to collectively address the crisis and take the classic ‘never again’ pledge. Two years later, they signed another declaration and took another pledge. But, merely six years on, we are witnessing a dramatic return of these catastrophic sea crossings. Clearly, something is failing. Is this a crisis of institutions? It is easy to blame institutions, but they do not fail by themselves. They are made to fail by the same people who create them. The Bay of Bengal region today is plagued, first and foremost, by a crisis of empathy. No government in the region wants to go out of its way to protect the Rohingya, let alone allow them to disembark in their territory. At the outset, this is because most of these countries are not state parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention. But, this isn’t just about one UN treaty. Rising xenophobia, nationalism, and sectarianism, manifested in hate speech, militarised border regimes, and coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media, continue to fuel institutional apathy in several parts of the region. This is a crisis that institutions, by themselves, cannot fix. It demands a wholesale change of popular attitudes and political narratives, backed by a conscientious recognition by all governments in the region that refugees need affirmative protection. This is not easy. Most nations don’t want to talk about the stateless community in bilateral or multilateral discussions, lest other ‘more important’ political, economic or security agendas fall apart. For this reason, a frank discussion about protecting Rohingya refugees at sea within the Bali Process, BIMSTEC, ASEAN or SAARC remains a pipe dream. So, if states are failing to protect them what can be done? One potential alternative is private sector or NGO participation in search and rescue operations in the Andaman Sea. In the Mediterranean Sea, the key conduits for migrant crossings from Africa to Europe are several humanitarian NGOs, such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and SOS Mediterranee. They work in tandem with governments and their maritime forces. Could this model be replicated in the Bay of Bengal region? In theory, yes. The Information Fusion Centre, Indian Ocean region (IFC-IOR), an integrated nodal point for maritime data collection, set up by the Indian government in 2018, could provide technical support to private rescue ships, given that it is already tracking irregular migrant crossings across the Indian Ocean. However, there remains the serious challenge of safe disembarkation. No country in the Bay of Bengal would likely be keen on receiving large groups of Rohingya refugees without a guarantee of swift repatriation. While this takes us back to square one, it is worth a try. Some countries in the region might, in fact, be happy to outsource refugee SAR operations to NGOs. Since this is a humanitarian crisis, all alternatives must be given a shot.",      
    "Topic77": "As many as 650 million women in the world today were married as children. About a third of them were married before the age of 15. In India, which has the dubious distinction of being home to the most number of child brides, UN estimates suggest that 1.5 million girls get married before they turn 18. About 16 per cent of girls in the age group of 15-19 are married at present. According to the 2011 census, 44 per cent of women in Assam were married before the age of 18. The figures for Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh were 47 per cent, 46 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s decision to give maximum priority to addressing this problem is well-meaning. Child marriages affect the national economy negatively and do not allow us to come out of the vicious cycle of inter-generational poverty. Child marriage deprives women of education and life skills. Early pregnancies adversely affect the physical and mental health of young mothers. The question, however, is: Are mass arrests and the indiscriminate use of criminal sanctions that the Assam government has resorted to, the only solution to the problem of child marriage? More than 4,000 FIRs have been filed and close to 2,500 people have been arrested in Assam in the past four days. Sarma has asserted that the crackdown will continue till the 2026 elections to the state assembly. The links between the polls and arrests as a solution to the age-old social problem aren’t quite clear. More importantly, deterrent theories of punishment have not succeeded anywhere in the world and are relics of the past in most places. Assam should not follow the example of regressive Muslim monarchies in the Middle East whose record on human rights and the rule of law is appalling. Scandinavian countries are good examples to follow. Modern international laws and conventions — the UN Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages (1962), the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979) and the Beijing Declaration (1995) — do mandate countries to stipulate a minimum legal age for marriage. But child marriages continue to have religious sanction in large parts of India. Hindu and Muslim Personal Laws do not explicitly prohibit child marriage. The Manusmritis say that if the father fails to marry off his daughter within three years of her attaining puberty, she can find a spouse on her own. According to Medhatithi, one of the oldest and earliest commentators on the Manusmriti, eight years is the right age for a girl to be given in marriage. The Rig Veda mentions garbhadhan — literally, attaining the wealth of the womb. It is the first of the 16 samskaras a Hindu is expected to perform. The Greek traveller Megasthenes (350-290 BC) has written that he was told that the women of the Pandian kingdom in South India bear children at six years of age. About seven centuries later, the Persian polymath, Al Biruni, wrote that child marriages were rampant in India. The Muslim clergy too considered child marriages to be valid, though such children have the option to nullify their marriage. The colonial state should be credited for reforming marriage laws. The Age of Consent Acts of 1861 and 1891 brought in reform in conjugal rights. The 1861 Act laid down 10 years as the minimum age for sexual intercourse. The Hindu intelligentsia opposed raising this age to 12 on the grounds that it violated norms related to garbhadhan. The death of 10-year-old Phulmoni Dasi in 1890 created public pressure to reform the Age of Consent Law. Phulmoni’s husband, Hari Mohan Maiti, was acquitted of charges of murder as she was just above the age of 10. Forty-four women doctors compiled a long list of child wives who had met the same fate as Phulmoni. The 1891 Act raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse to 12. Four years before this, the Rukmabai case gave new impetus to the campaign of social reformers like M G Ranade and Behramji Merwanji Malabari. Rukmabai had refused to solemnise her marriage, which had taken place when she was 11. Her husband Dadaji Bikaji had filed a petition for the restitution of his conjugal rights. He was supported by conservative Hindus including Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When the Age of Consent Act was amended in 1891, the conservatives criticised it as interference in Hindu society. Tilak’s newspapers Maratha and Kesari were at the forefront of this campaign. Rukmabai was probably the original Shah Bano, who stood up for her rights. These laws, however, had limited impact. In 1927, Rai Sahib Har Bilas Sarda introduced the Child Marriage Restraint Act in the Legislative Council of India and sought a ban on marriages of children below the age of 12. The legislation was passed in 1929 – it raised the age of marriage to 14 for girls and 18 for boys. After Independence, the marriageable age for girls was raised to 15 in 1949 and 18 in 1978. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, stipulates imprisonment of two years or a fine which can go up to Rs 1 lakh, or both. In several cases – P Venkataramana (1977), Rabindra (1986), G Saravanan (2017) — high courts have ruled that child marriages are neither void nor voidable but valid. In 2021, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held a Muslim girl’s marriage after attaining puberty as valid. The Supreme Court has recently agreed to hear this issue. On January 11, 2023, the Karnataka High Court refused to hold a marriage with a minor girl as void, under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In the Hadiya case (2018), the Supreme Court mentioned attainment of puberty, and not 18 years, as the minimum age of marriage, as one of the conditions for a valid Muslim marriage. In its 205th Report (2008), the Law Commission has rightly suggested that poverty, indebtedness and dowry are the main reasons that poor families marry off their daughters at an early age. The Assam government should use education and a mass campaign to educate parents, rather than a coercive criminal law, to deal with the problem of child marriages. In the period between 2000-2010, the growth of women’s education, government investment in adolescent girls and public messaging have brought down the percentage of child marriages appreciably — from 47 per cent to 30 per cent. If in Assam, child marriages are more prevalent amongst Muslims, educating Muslim girls should be given the highest priority. Let the energetic CM of the state recognise the complex nature of this social problem which no criminal law can really tackle. Let him implement Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visionary and practical solution of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao.",      
    "Topic78": "Citizens across the world strive for a workable system with its own preferences. This is enshrined in the Constitution, which becomes a meeting ground for the state and citizens to co-exist as autonomous entities. In most democracies, the constitution is guided by constitutionalism, which is the power to limit the government’s absolutism. This idea was propagated by the likes of John Locke, who was an architect of constitutional liberalism, which kept citizens over the elected government. Political theorist and legal philosopher Montesquieu had a different but identical proposition: to divide the government and its powers and limit its centrality. In his opus, The Spirit of the Laws (1748), Montesquieu provides a detailed overview of the differences between political power and government which were one and the same, though operated differently in philosophy and practice, i.e., policy. Montesquieu offered what his English translator Thomas Nugent stated as an ‘art of government’ to the sovereigns. This, indeed, was a model that was radical, controversial, methodical, scholarly, and transitionary. The division of state power forms a standard template of today’s constitutional vision in most states. However, legal scholars have raised the issue of separation of powers as ambiguous. Aileen Kavanagh sees the separation of powers as interdependent, non-facilitatory. This model purports a purist view of how things should be instead of having a constructive view of what is actually happening. The practicality of the separation of power through constitutionalism is meant to preserve the value of the constitution that rests power in the re-public. Many commentators of the Constitution have relied on the vagueness of the written word and thus emboldened the grammarians of constitutions to interpret. The constitution became a source of thinking and a turf of contestation. The constitution, in theory, is a piece of written code acting as a supreme law of the land. The constitution is the basis of various legislation, treatises, and a model of conducting state affairs. It provides the basis for the distribution of powers, ranks, institutions, bodies, and organs of the state. Is it why the conversation surrounding the prose of the constitution is embedded in state and subjects? To understand this part of history, we must visit the Medieval European age. Medieval England is a source of much of the capitalist history of the modern world. The feature of this period was the reign of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. This was when invading forces across the North Sea and the English Channel were trying to overtake the grey, isolated island that offered refuge and part-prestige to the scions of Normans and Danes. The fishing settlement of England was attractive for trade and location. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were a structured hierarchy. The king was on top and had absolute authority. His family members gained special privileges and protection. Beneath them were thegns, the second-rank aristocrats, nobles. This was followed by a provincial polity of freemen, business holders and peasants. The royalty relied on the allegiance between lords and their subordinates. Anglo-Saxons were subdued by the Norman elites, who practically displaced the erstwhile Germanic rulers of England. The English barons started to pay their obeisance and tax to the new ruler. However, the relationship was fraught. It saw rebellion and the rise of a new class willing to confront the king. The monarch, King John, received a big blow when the protesting barons captured the Tower of London. Helpless, King John decided to negotiate. The barons came up with their list of demands that came to be known as the Article of Barons, which eventually formed a sizable portion of the world’s first written constitution, the Magna Carta, in 1215. In it, the King was held responsible under the law, a practice seen as unbecoming of the king, who was usually above the law. Nay, the monarch was the law. We have come a long way from the medieval age. The spirit of a social contract and its relationship with the state and subjects in a capitalist society has undergone profound changes. England, which had seen the birth of modern constitutionalism, did not carry the spirit of the constitution. It does not have a written constitution. Modern legal thinking is credited much to the enlightenment era thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and David Hume (The History of England). The modern parlance of legal maxims and protection of codes and customs through fundamental law, vis a vis constitution, is taken from recent histories of civilization and governance. This European period was marred in controversy and inconsistency, yet the intellectual provenance to guide a state with citizen rule was guaranteed through vote and tax collection. The idea of an Indian republic established through the written word was first propagated by Samrat Ashok, who wrote down the manifesto and model of his ideal society on the rock edits as a constitutional guide—the law of the Dhamma to his empire. In the history of the constitution of nations, the Magna Carta has a unique position. India’s history of the constitution has been confrontational. Indians relate democracy to the constitution. The existence of the constitution does not guarantee democratic ethos as a precondition for society. The Dharmashastra, Sutras, and Smritis acted as a fundamental ethic of sovereigns over multiple millennia, which did not authorize democracy centred on the liberty of individuals. In An Argumentative Indian, Amartya Sen sees this blending of western and Indian ideals as contributing to the making of India’s modern constitutional history. This he notes through the long tradition of dialogue and debates existing in epics that are venerated as the ancient history of India’s civilizational output. Yet, the same canon of historical thought is undergirded by immorality and the practice of hierarchy. That is why when it came to talking about the Indian Constitution, the architect emphasized its morality of it, which he contended was proof of an alive society. Pratap Bhanu Mehta attributes this doctrine of Ambedkar as ‘anti-revolutionary’ that partly drew upon George Grote’s faith in the archetype of constitutional authority. I think Ambedkar was also gesturing to the rebellious class to have faith in the system and not burn down the republic to ashes, as change has some portion of anxiety and patience. Morality meant a commitment to an idea but more to one’s discomfort–a premise of benevolence shown to the nation.",      
    "Topic79": "Context is crucial. To understand the constraints and imperatives this year’s budget faced, one has to appreciate the crosscurrents the global and domestic economies are experiencing. The global outlook, for instance, is clouded with uncertainty that could break in several different ways. One possibility: Global growth and labour markets remain so resilient that core inflation does not soften enough to reach central bank targets, necessitating ‘high for long’ interest rates in advanced economies that risk a hard landing and/or a financial stability event. The implication: Emerging markets will have to worry about macroeconomic stability, a redux of last year. A second possibility: The US – whose growth momentum is slowing markedly – slips into recession, pulling parts of the global economy with it. Inflation comes off and central banks quickly pivot. But now, emerging markets face the opposite problem. The global economy becomes a large drag on growth. A third Goldilocks scenario is that advanced economies’ growth slows enough to bring inflation down but not enough to trigger a sharp recession, generating the ‘soft landing’ that markets are fervently hoping for. What this range of outcomes reveals is the sheer global uncertainty – in quantum and direction – that policymakers have to contend with. Should the focus in 2023 be to preserve macro stability? Or should it be to anticipate the global slowdown’s impact on India’s growth and act preemptively to mitigate it? It’s not clear. Add to this, the domestic trade-offs. Both corporate and bank balance sheets are in the best shape they’ve been in years, such that the ‘twin balance sheet’ constraint is no longer binding. Yet, a broad-based private investment cycle can take time, given elevated global uncertainty, utilisation rates still being in the 70s and monetary conditions tightening. Given this private sector diffidence and the prospect of exports slowing meaningfully, the budget needed to double down on the capex thrust that it rightfully embarked on during the pandemic. Simultaneously, however, the budget could not take its eye off fiscal prudence. Total public sector borrowing in 2022-23 was upwards of 9 per cent of GDP and with the current account deficit widening discernibly (though peak pressures appear behind us) and core inflation so sticky, fiscal consolidation was needed to help ameliorate domestic and external imbalances. The budget’s ask was, therefore, manifold: The need to simultaneously protect macro stability yet foster growth. The need to simultaneously push on public investment yet reduce the deficit. To its credit, the budget has pulled off a most artful balancing act, ticking all the right boxes. For a fourth successive year, the leitmotif of the budget was a big push towards capital expenditure and infrastructure creation. In the throes of the pandemic, this column had argued repeatedly that a big public investment push was the need of the hour – to spur growth and job creation – and that this was India’s ‘New Deal’ moment (‘India’s new deal moment’, IE, January 11, 2021). To their credit, policymakers have delivered in spades. In just three years, central capex has jumped from its long-standing average of 1.7 per cent of GDP to 2.7 per cent. Not satisfied, this year’s budget has (correctly) doubled down on its bets and boldly targeted central capex at 3.3 per cent of GDP next year. If achieved, this would constitute a doubling of capex in just four years. One cannot overstate the importance of a sustained public investment push at this moment in time for blue-collar job creation, crowding-in private investment, improving economic competitiveness and eventually boosting potential growth. The collateral impact is a sharp improvement in the quality of expenditure on the Centre’s budget. Subsidies had ballooned on the back of the pandemic and the Ukraine war but are expected to mean revert from next year. Outside of that, the quality of spending has markedly improved. Revenue expenditure (net of interest and subsidies) used to be 4.5 times the capex allocation in 2019-20. This year, the ratio is expected to fall to about 2.5 and, if the budgeted projections fructify, fall further to two next year. There is a clear thrust in the central budget to invest rather than consume. Simultaneously, however, the budget has not lost track of the need to consolidate. Apart from consolidating 0.5 per cent of GDP next year – which is pragmatic given the risks to growth this year — the budget speech re-affirmed the central fiscal deficit will be brought below 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26 – thereby committing to at least 1.5 per cent of GDP consolidation over the next two years. This is much needed. India’s Achilles heel has always been not creating enough fiscal space during recoveries, and therefore often being left with inadequate fiscal ammunition when the need arises. In sum, the budget ticked all the right boxes: Improving the quality of spending, staying on a consolidation path, re-affirming medium-term fiscal targets, while avoiding any negative surprises for markets. Are there risks to monitor? There always are. The growth recovery and elevated inflation meant tax buoyancy is strong this year. The ratio of gross taxes (net of excise) is projected to be 1.2 this fiscal. Next year, the budget effectively retains tax buoyancy at 1.2 (after adjusting for the tax changes). However, with both growth and inflation expected to slow (the budget projects 10.5 per cent nominal growth next year versus 15.4 per cent this year), the risk is tax buoyancy could be lower next year. Furthermore, for this year’s targets to be reached, gross taxes (net of excise) would need to grow upwards of 16 per cent in the January-March quarter, vis-à-vis 9 per cent growth in the last quarter. If this year’s targets don’t fructify, it further increases the tax buoyancy that will be needed to hit next year’s targets. Making point estimates – as the budget is forced to do – is particularly challenging in times of such uncertainty. But this is an area that policymakers will need to closely monitor, so that contingency revenue plans are made in case nominal GDP or tax buoyancy don’t fructify, so the capex thrust is protected. A second focus area must be to improve the absorptive capacity of states and PSU’s who have been lagging on capex in recent years — including this year — such that, despite the Center’s thrust, broader public capex has been flat in recent years. A third focus area must be to double down on revenue mobilisation in the coming years. Lower food and fertiliser subsidies in FY24 created a hefty 0.8 per cent of GDP in fiscal space that was used to reduce the deficit and boost capex. But that opportunity will not arise every year. If the deficit is to be brought down by 1.5 per cent of GDP in the next two years without cannibalising capex, and much needed investments in health and education are to be made, the focus must be on mobilising revenues (both direct and indirect taxes) and revving up asset sales. For now, however, the budget brings much-needed predictability and continuity. Amidst the continuing global storm, it provides a steady hand on the tiller while simultaneously laying the groundwork to pick up the pace when the tide turns.",      
    "Topic80": "An IMF mission is currently in Pakistan to negotiate a bailout of the world’s fifth-most populous country that has an unenviable record of going to the IMF 23 times since 1958 — the most by any country during this period. The negotiations could be the toughest Pakistan has ever had with the IMF. Islamabad has reportedly sought Washington’s help in securing softer conditions but was advised to resume to talks with the IMF. The IMF’s programme was practically in suspension since November last year, mainly due to Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s refusal to meet the IMF demands to stick to a market-determined exchange rate and take measures to reduce the growing fiscal deficit. Pakistan’s current year budget has a revenue target of Rs 7.4 trillion, 52 per cent of which was allocated to servicing the debts and 33 per cent to defence, including pensions. Hence, Pakistan has little fiscal space with a total debt-to-GDP ratio of around 90 per cent. The government is reportedly considering imposing additional taxes of Rs 200 billion to satisfy the IMF’s concerns about the fiscal deficit, which could reach 6.5 per cent of the GDP against the target of 4.9 due to a sharp escalation in debt servicing costs and a shortfall in tax collection. It is unlikely that the IMF would agree to a higher fiscal deficit and is likely to insist on higher revenue collections – as high as Rs 800 billion — according to some sources, including through an increase in electricity and gas tariffs, and spending cuts. Last year’s unprecedented torrential rains and floods compounded Pakistan’s economic woes, with estimated losses of around $30 billion. According to the United Nations, months after unprecedented floods ravaged Pakistan, vast swathes of cropland and villages remain underwater. International donors have pledged around $9 billion but 90 per cent of this ‘aid’ is in the form of loans and is not available for the immediate balance of payments support. The country’s official foreign exchange reserves have dropped to a dangerous level of just $3.2 billion, equivalent to less than three weeks of imports. Even if the IMF mission reaches an agreement with Pakistan, it could take some time before the latter will get any money. The current $6.5 billion IMF programme was initiated in 2019 (it was extended to June 2023 last year) and Pakistan has already received $3.9 billion. Even if the IMF programme is revived soon, the next tranche of around $1.1 billion — for that matter the entire remaining amount — may not be enough to shore up Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves to a safe level. Pakistan has received financial help from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates in the form of deposits and credits totalling around $10 billion. Last month, Pakistan managed to avoid default due to a $3 billion lifeline provided by the UAE in the shape of a rollover of the $2 billion of existing debt and new financing of $1 billion. Saudi Arabia agreed to fund just $1 billion worth of oil imports on deferred payment, which is not enough to finance even one month of Pakistan’s oil import needs. Pakistan could face a crunch in fuel supplies in February as banks have stopped financing and facilitating payments for imports due to depleting foreign exchange reserves. The Pakistan rupee’s precipitous fall during the last week of January has raised fears that Pakistan may be the next emerging market to default. Pakistan’s currency dropped 9.6 per cent against the US dollar on January 26 to an all-time low in the largest single-day fall in at least two decades as the country abandoned controls on its currency exchange rate as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s beleaguered government attempted to placate the IMF. The government also raised gasoline prices by around 16 per cent on 29 January. Earlier in January, a nationwide power outage in Pakistan left nearly 220 million people without electricity, threatening to cause havoc in the country already on the brink of default amidst a deepening political crisis, a rudderless political leadership, and 25 per cent crippling inflation. Factories, hospitals and schools across the country were without power for hours for two days. The authorities claimed the power breakdown was caused by technical faults but many doubted this and linked it to fuel shortages. Now there is a growing fear that the country could soon run out of fuel that powers the electricity generation plants. In addition to the country-wide power outages, Pakistan faces a worsening wheat crisis, which reportedly has led to citizens fighting over bags of flour and at least one person getting trampled to death. Pakistan expanded its electricity generation capacity under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Programme (CPEC) but the expansion came at a high cost both in terms of high returns guaranteed to the Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) and the expensive foreign currency debt. Pakistan has been unable to make the capacity payments to IPPs under the long-term power purchase agreements with the electricity sector debt rising to a staggering $ 8.5 billion. China is Pakistan’s largest bilateral creditor with about $30 billion in total debt, which represents about 30 per cent of the country’s total external official debt. In addition, Pakistan owes $1.1 billion to Chinese IPPs for power purchases. Last December, the government agreed to repay this debt in instalments. However, this may have displeased the IMF, which had expected the government, in August 2022, to renegotiate the purchase power agreements. Pakistan tried to renegotiate but the Chinese refused. Pakistan is squeezed between the demands of the IMF and Chinese interests. Rescheduling debts can provide some relief but who will bite the bullet first? The Chinese or the international financial institutions that are owed $41 billion? Pakistan’s central bank chief has admitted that the country has to repay $8 billion in the next five months and claimed that $5 billion of this will be rolled over. That still leaves the daunting task of raising at least $3 billion to meet its external debt obligations and another around $5 billion to fund the current account deficit. In total, Pakistan needs at least $9-10 billion to stabilise the external account situation and the currency. According to the IMF, Pakistan’s debt servicing requirement would be around $25 billion per annum for the next three years. It looks almost inevitable that the debts will have to be restructured or rescheduled. However, that would come later and would put more pressure on the finances. For now, only an immediate and large bailout can save Pakistan from default. Otherwise, it could be headed toward what Sri Lanka experienced last year. If it goes in that direction, it may see unprecedented social turmoil and political unrest.",      
    "Topic81": "The triangular dynamic between the US, Russia and China has long been the principal factor shaping independent India’s geopolitics. The unveiling of a new Sino-Russian alliance a year ago this week, the Russian aggression towards Ukraine, and the deepening confrontation between the West and Russia and China are compelling India to recalibrate its international relations. Last February, Vladimir Putin travelled to Beijing to unveil a partnership ‘without limits’ and with no ‘forbidden areas’. To be sure, Russia and China had a strategic partnership for a long time before Putin’s February 2022 visit. What the Beijing declaration did was lay out a solid basis for jointly confronting the West. Until the turn of the 2010s, both Moscow and Beijing sought a productive relationship with the US. Russia’s accumulating grievances against the West and China’s new ambition to replace the US as Asia’s dominant power have brought them much closer now. A few days after issuing the declaration on February 4, Putin invaded Ukraine. We do not know the nature of the consultations, if any, on Ukraine when Putin and Xi Jinping met in Beijing. It is not unreasonable to presume that the Sino-Russian alliance added to Moscow’s confidence in risking a confrontation with the West in Europe. Putin had hoped that his multi-pronged military offensive would force a quick collapse of the regime in Kyiv and fold Ukraine’s sovereignty into Russia’s. Imagine for a moment he had gotten away with this in Ukraine. Putin, who had long complained about the European security order, would have driven a stake through its heart. A quick, decisive and successful use of force in Ukraine would have deeply divided Europe and fractured the US-led trans-Atlantic security system that dominated the region for more than seven decades. Coming less than a year after the ignominious US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Moscow’s absorption of Ukraine would have further undermined the credibility of the US as a global power. Putin’s victory in Europe would have had a dramatic impact on Asia too. It would have reinforced the sentiment that America is in terminal decline, weakened US alliances in Asia, and boosted China’s ambition to radically reshape its periphery. If Putin had successfully conquered Ukraine, Xi’s path to unification with Taiwan through the use of force or mere coercive diplomacy might have eased. But the Sino-Russian project of building a post-Western global order went awry in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s defiant courage prevented the quick collapse of the regime in Kyiv and that, in turn, helped mobilise massive military assistance from the Western world. Nearly a year after the invasion, Putin is locked in a grinding stalemate. He has lost nearly 50 per cent of the territory Russia gained in eastern Ukraine during the early phase of the invasion. Russia’s military material and manpower losses have been immense and Moscow faces a harsh regime of Western economic sanctions. Where does this leave the Sino-Russian alliance and what are its implications for India? Several preliminary assessments can be laid out. First, instead of delivering a final blow to the US primacy in the international system, Putin and Xi have facilitated the resurrection of Western unity under American leadership. The Ukraine invasion has also allowed the US to put simultaneous pressure on both China and Russia. In Europe, Putin’s war has helped the US galvanise and expand NATO. The Russian invasion has also triggered the fear of Chinese territorial expansionism in Asia. This has led to the strengthening of US bilateral alliances with Australia and Japan. Washington has significantly raised its military and political support for Taipei and is making it harder for Xi to embark on an invasion of Taiwan. Second, the Sino-Russian alliance and the Ukraine war have seen two reluctant and pacifist powers — Germany and Japan — join the battle against Moscow and Beijing. Japan and Germany happen to be the world’s third and fourth largest economies and their mobilisation significantly alters the so-called ‘correlation of forces’ between the West and the Moscow-Beijing axis. Both Berlin and Tokyo are now committed to raising their defence spending to cope with the security challenges from Moscow and Beijing. Despite their huge stakes in economic engagement with Russia and China, Berlin and Tokyo have had no choice but to join Washington in ramping up the commercial pressure against Russia and China. Third, if Russia and China thought they could dominate Eurasia through an alliance, Washington is doing something similar to bring its alliances and partnerships in Europe and Asia closer. We saw the leaders of America’s Asian allies join for the first time a NATO summit last June in Madrid. NATO, in turn, has promised to take a greater interest in shaping the Indo-Pacific balance of power. Fourth, while the jury is out on the future of the Sino-Russian alliance, there is a growing prospect that Moscow will become more beholden to Beijing after Putin’s military misadventure in Ukraine. The poor Russian strategic performance may have diminished Putin’s standing with Xi and complicated China’s plans, but Beijing is unlikely to abandon Moscow. A weakened Putin will remain a valuable asset for Xi even as Beijing seeks to blunt some of the new Western hostility to China. Finally, India’s discomfort in the messy menage a trois with Russia and China will only grow. The Sino-Russian alliance puts India in a terrible predicament: China can ramp up, at will, the military pressure on the disputed border with India; Delhi depends on Russian military supplies to cope with the PLA challenge; and Moscow is now a junior partner to Beijing. This is certainly not a nice place for Delhi to be in. To make matters worse, the dependence on Russian arms has severely constrained India’s position on Ukraine and cast a shadow over Delhi’s engagement with Europe and the US. If the Russian partnership was long seen as the key to India’s ‘strategic autonomy’, Delhi’s arms dependence on Moscow is now the biggest constraint on India’s freedom of action. Nearly three decades ago, India turned to Russia and China to promote a multipolar world amidst a unipolar moment dominated by the US. As it faced the prospect of a unipolar Asia dominated by a rising and assertive China, Delhi has turned to the US and its allies to restore the regional balance of power. The transition, however, has at once become more urgent and complicated by the new Sino-Russian alliance and President Putin’s war against Ukraine.",      
    "Topic82": "The visit of Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, to Delhi this week is not just about India rebuilding ties with an old friend that had been on the margins of Delhi’s diplomacy for too long. India’s decision to elevate bilateral ties to the strategic level is rooted in a recognition of the enduring salience of Egypt as a pivotal state sitting at the crossroads of the Middle East, Africa and Europe, with the capacity to influence political outcomes on multiple fronts. Beyond bilateral ties, the renewed engagement with Egypt is also about expanding and consolidating India’s new coalition with moderate Sunni states in the Middle East, including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are eager to counter violent religious extremism. Stabilising the shared neighbourhood through political and security cooperation has unsurprisingly figured at the top of India’s new strategic partnership with Egypt. The current Indian strategy of working with a coalition of moderate Sunni states is very different from Delhi’s past discourse on the Middle East and is in tune with the shifting regional realities. India’s renewed engagement with Egypt should take us beyond the banal claim that Delhi enjoys ‘good relations’ with all the major countries in the Middle East. What we see in Delhi today is an effort to align India’s regional diplomatic priorities closer to India’s core interests. Delhi’s strategic partnership with Cairo also opens the door for a larger Indian role in the region which is trying to diversify its partnerships, as the US begins to turn its attention to the Pacific after prolonged and costly military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, China is rapidly raising its regional profile in the Middle East. At the peak of earlier India-Egypt bonhomie in the 1950s and 1960s, the regional context was vastly different than what it is today. At that time, India and Egypt joined hands to limit the role of the West in the region and promoted such supra-national forces such as pan-Asianism, pan-Arabism and Third Worldism. They worked together on isolating Israel and fighting for the liberation of Palestine. The region has come a long way since then. After the 1973 war, Egypt dumped its military ties to the Soviet Union and turned to the US as a strategic partner. Egypt was the first Arab state to recognise Israel (Turkey was the first Muslim state to establish relations with Israel). The Indian foreign policy discourse, with its deepening anti-Western rhetoric and empathy for radical Arab States in the 1970s, was not empathetic to the concerns and interests of Egypt as it made brave moves to rethink its regional policies. The governments in Delhi took a long time adapting to the shifting alignments in the region and new developments that rocked regional politics, including four major developments in 1979 — signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the Islamic revolution in Iran, the attack on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in December. In the subsequent years, the Iran-Iraq war, the conflict between US and Iran, US wars in Iraq, the 9/11 attacks, and the rise of Arab oil wealth transformed the region beyond recognition. It was only after the 1990s that India began to reorient its regional policies by recognising Israel, by stepping up engagement with the Gulf, which was now becoming a major source of energy for India’s accelerated economic growth, a major destination for labour exports and hard currency remittances. The new situation presented challenges of its own. As India’s commercial interests grew with the Gulf, relations with the Western part of the Middle East began to decline. Within the Gulf too, the Indian strategic focus tended to be riveted on Iran that was deemed critical to India’s Afghan strategies. Iran was the only gateway to Central Asia given Pakistan’s reluctance to offer India overland access to Afghanistan and inner Asia. But Delhi’s ties with Tehran remain constrained because of the continuing confrontation between Iran and the West on a range of issues.

After the Arab Spring in 2011, Egypt and the Gulf Arabs have also come together to confront challenges from Sunni extremist forces in the region, like the Muslim Brotherhood backed by Turkey and Qatar. India is no stranger to this problem since it has been at the receiving end of the Islamist policies of Ankara and Doha. The Arab Spring has galvanised the moderate Sunni Arab leaders in Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia to actively counter violent religious extremism and contest the narratives of the radical Islamists. While Egypt has long been an inclusive society, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been deeply religious and conservative Islamic societies. They are now actively pursuing internal social reform, promoting religious tolerance and countering extremist ideologies. The evolution of the Middle East towards political moderation and social modernisation is indeed of special interest, not only to India but also to the entire Subcontinent. The extremist ideas from the Middle East had their unfortunate resonance in South Asia, destabilising internal and intra-regional dynamics in the Subcontinent over the last few decades. India, therefore, has a big stake in building a strong coalition with moderate Arab Sunni states that could help promote peace and stability in both the Middle East and South Asia.",      
    "Topic83": "Health is wealth and nutrition plays an important role in carning this wealth. Nutrition helps to keep the body healthy and in good shape. However, the food that is available is not nutritic and does not eradicate hunger, India suffers from malnutrition, both under nutrition and over nutrition, which leads to deficiency diseases and obesity respectively. India is ranked 102 out of 117 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2019, behind its neighbours Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Indian diets are rich in staple, provide calories but not nourishment. Food quality, safety and security are of paramount importance as malnutrition is responsible for numerous deaths. Food fortification is the process of adding micronutrients (essential trace elements and vitamins) to food. It can be carried out by food manufacturers or by governments as a public health policy to reduce the number of people with dietary deficiencies within the population. According to the definition of World Health Organisation (WHO) and Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), fortification refers to ‘the practice of deliberately increasing the content of an essential micronutrients like vitamins and minerals (including trace elements) in a food, so as to improve the nutritional quality of food supply and to provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health’. To push for development, growth and productivity, a country needs to have population that has food consisting of nutrients. This will help in reducing morbidity and injecting positive health trends in population. India has made great progress while dealing with the prevailing hunger and malnutrition. India has a very high burden of micronutrient deficiencies caused by vitamin A, iodine, iron and folic acid leading to night blindness, goitre, anaemia and various birth defects. Over 70% of the Indian population still consumes less than half of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) endorsed micronutrients. This is a major contributing factor to prevalent health concerns such as stunting, low immunity, cognitive losses and physical impairments. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) 384% of children months) are anaemic, 53.1% women in the reproductive age group are anaemic and 35.7% of children under 5 are underweight. Food fortification can help to address the issue of these micronutrient deficiencies. It is a scientifically proven scalable and cost-effective strategy to improve the health and nutritional status of the most vulnerable sections of our society. There are mainly three types of food fortification. They are (i) Commercial and industrial fortification like wheat, flour, corn, meat, cooking oils (ii) Biofortification i.e. breeding crops to increase their nutritional value. (ii) Home fortification i.e an innovation aimed at improving diet quality of nutritionally vulnerable groups such as children. For example, vitamin D drops. Food fortification is considered an efficient public health strategy because it can reach wider susceptible populations through existing food delivery systems without requiring major changes in existing consumption patterns. It acts as an effective short-term approach to address the nutrition gaps within a population. The long-term, sustainable approach would be to diversify people's dietary patterns by encouraging higher consumption of locally produced seasonal food. Compared to other nutrition interventions, food fortification is more cost-effective if it is coupled with existing technology and large-scale distribution systems such as the MDM Scheme, ICDS, PDS, etc. The food fortification also helps us to reduce the health care costs related to nutritional disorders. Thus it becomes necessary to move in a direction where fortified food is available and easy to access by all. It helps to improve the health of a large section of the population, all at once as the nutrients are added to the widely consumed staple foods. Article 47 of Indian Constitution directs the state to raise the level of nutrition and standard of living in people and improve public health as among its primary duties. Thus, India has launched nutrition security measures such as the Public Distribution System (PDS), Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme, and Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) etc. The National Nutrition Policy, 1993 has identified and placed fortification of essential food as a short term direct nutrient intervention and states that essential food items shall be fortified with appropriate nutrients. Some of the measures taken by the government are (i) National Policy on Salt Iodisation India is one of the first countries in the world to start a public health programme to address iodine deficiency disorders based on salt iodisation. A national policy of universal salt iodisation was started in India in 1986 which prohibits the sale of non-iodised salt for human consumption. Later in order to combat iron and iodine deficiencies, India implemented double fortification of salt, iron and iodine. (ii) Five Year Plans promoting food fortification has been part of 10th, 11th and 12th Five Year National Plans of the country. To keep up the spirit to achieve nutritional security, India has secured micronutrients for beneficiaries by including fortified foods as an additional supplement to nutritious meals for which it has launched Food Fortification Initiative. (iii) Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been authorised for setting the standard for fortification of food articles like wheat, flour, rice, milk, edible oil and salts with vitamins and minerals. At present, all the major oil producers in the country are voluntarily fortifying at least one brand in their product portfolios. The Draft Food and Standards (fortification of food) Regulations, 2016 stipulate that FSSAI may from time to time mandate fortification of any food article. It can be done on the direction of government of India or recommendations of the states/UTs under Food Safety and Standards (prohibition and restrictions on sales), sale of only iodised salt is permitted for direct human consumption. It also provides that Vanaspati shall contain synthetic vitamin A. FSSAI has established Food Fortification Resource Centre (FFRC) in collaboration with Tata trusts to promote large scale fortification of food. (iii) Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Human Resource Development have advised the use of double fortified salt (Iron and lodine), wheat flour (with Iron, folic acid and vitamin B-12) and edible oil (with vitamin A and D) under their schemes. (iv) Movements for Behavioural Change India have set its pace to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 for which it has started The Eat Right Movement. This movement brings together three on-going initiatives of FSSAI i.e. 'Safe and Nutritious Food Initiative', which focused on social and behavioural change around food safety and nutrition at home, school, workplace and The Eat Healthy Campaign', which focused on reduction of high fat, sugar and salt foods in the diet and 'Food Fortification', which focused on promoting five staple foods i.e. wheat flour, rice, oil, milk and salt that are added with key vitamins and minerals to improve their nutritional content. There is a need to create a policy environment for making compulsory fortification a national agenda. The other issue is the partnership with industry to set up the translatable technologies. Behavioural change communication is required to mitigate stakeholder's reluctance to change. Shelf life and packaging for fortified rice (stored rice) is also a great challenge. Effective monitoring is required for the careful consideration of the effect of other fortified foods and supplements. Several organisations like WHO, FAO lave acknowledged that there are limitations to food fortification. Fortification of nutrients in food may deliver excessive amount of nutrients to some individual with side effects. For example, Fluoride can cause irreversible staining to the teeth Iron might be beneficial for women but it might result into over consumption in case of men. Besides, there are several human rights issue like consumer’s right to choose if they want fortified products or not. Some of the future course of action is given below (a) There is a need to engage stakeholders to understand the importance of more and up to date databases on food and nutrient intakes. (b) There is a need for better tracking/reporting systems to look for potential adverse effects of excessive nutrient exposures. (c) More research is needed to quantify the nano materials as fortificants. (d) There is need to understand the link between consumption and outcomes of the changes occuring as a result of food processing. Sustainable approaches in bringing diversity in the dietary habits of the citizens, food fortification can be seen as one of the important ways forward in improving the health of the citizens of the country. Further, there is need to develop wide consumer outreach to build awareness and sensitise people to the need and importance of fortification. The need of the hour is to strengthen measures of food fortification and harness fully the benefits of food fortification to place India on the path of sustained growth, prosperity and well-being.",      
    "Topic84": "Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units and to verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are a type if digital currencies, alternative currencies and virtual currencies. The first decentralised cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, created in 2009. Since then numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created. Cryptocurrencies use decentralised control as opposed to centralised electronic money and central banking systems. The decentralised control of each cryptocurrency works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database functioning as a distributed ledger. Transactions are sent between peers using software called cryptocurrency wallets (for storing, sending and receiving digital currency). The person creating the transactions uses the wallet software to transfer funds from one account to another. To transfer funds, knowledge of password associated with the account is needed. Transactions made between peers are encrypted and then broadcast to the cryptocurrency's network. It is then put in a queue to be added to the public ledger. Transaction is then recorded on the public ledger via a process called 'Mining' all users of a given cryptocurrency have access to the ledger if they choose to access it. The transaction amounts are public, but who sent the transactions is encrypted. Many transactions are added to a ledger at once. Then 'blocks' of transactions are added sequentially by miners. That is why the ledger and the technology behind it are called 'block chain. It is a 'chain of blocks of transactions. The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by blockchain. It is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity because they provide privacy protection, cost effectiveness; lower entry barriers which can be used as alternative to banking systems and fiat currencies, open source methodology and public participation and also immunity to government led financial retribution. Every transaction is transparent, autonomous and secure. Cryptocurrencies are digital and hence cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender. Cryptocurrency uses a 'push' mechanism that allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant or recipient with no further information. Decentralisation is one of the main advantage of cryptocurrency as it is managed by its own network and not any central authority. Since cryptocurrency is not bound by exchange rates, transaction charges or other charges of any country and hence it can be used at an International level without any problem. It is eco-friendly as it is paperless. Anonymity is one of the greatest advantages provided by cryptocurrency as one need not to reveal its identity. Due to these benefits cryptocurrency started to gain acceptance worldwide. Facebook has officially launched its virtual currency named 'Libra'. It will be governed by the Libra Association, a Swiss Group including 28 members. It would run on a block chain on which cryptocurrency payments take place. Cryptocurrencies have their own set of associated risks. Most people are not aware of how to use cryptocurrency and hence become vulnerable to hacking. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile in nature. There is a lack of central issues, which means that there is no legal formal entity to guarantee in case of any bankruptcy. There is not a way to get a refund of the amount paid mistakenly by someone. If a person has stored digital currency on his phone or computer then it is better to remember the passwords and not lose these devices. Losing one's coin means one I would not be able to retrieve it. Cryptocurrencies are being denounced in many countries because of their use in grey and black markets. There are two sets of interconnected risks, one being to the growth and expansion of these platforms in the uncertain policy environment and the other being the risks these platforms pose to the users and the security of the state. They also have the potential use for illicit trade and criminal activities and can be used for Terror Financing. They also have the potential for tax evasion. The acceptability of cryptocurrencies as a legal instrument currently varies from country to country. While some are in the process of formulating laws and measures, others are yet to respond to this disruptive change. Some countries like Algeria, Bolivia and Egypt etc. have completely banned the cryptocurrencies. An implicit ban has been applied in another 15 countries like Bahrain, Bangladesh, and China etc. Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency. UNICEF accepts cryptocurrency donations. Slowly, cryptocurrencies are coming under the regulatory net in order to check misuse. Japan became the first country to regulate cryptocurrencies, the US is quickly laying down regulatory guidelines. The UK and Australia continue to work on the formalities while China has recently banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) due to various reasons, including various ICO scams around the world. The burgeoning use of cryptocurrencies in terror financing, ransomwares, illicit drugs or arms trade and cybercrime has also raised red flags among the security and law enforcement agencies. They may well have the potential to displace the existing financial systems which enable electronic flow of money across different political boundaries. India plays a relatively small role in the global cryptocurrency market as it has only 2% of the global cryptocurrency market cap. The Reserve Bank of India has been keeping a tab on the increasing use of cryptocurrencies and it had issued an advisory in this regard in 2013, cautioning users, holders and traders of virtual currencies to its potential financial, legal and security related risks. The Ministry of Finance also held a public consultation on regulating virtual currencies in May 2017. In March 2020, Supreme Court of India declared the April 2018, notification of RBI that had banned the transactions through virtual currencies, as unconstitutional. This may lead to increase in the use of cryptocurrencies in India if authorised as an electronic payment system or designated a legal instrument. cryptocurrencies will fall under the purview of the RBI; capital gains and business transactions will be liable to tax, and foreign payments are also going to fall under the purview of Foreign Exchange Management Act. Regulated cryptocurrences will enshrine robust consumer protection provisions. Owing to this unstable and nascent phase of cryptocurrencies and less realisation of its worth due to limited use, it is foreseen that while people of India are eager and looking forward to transparent, quick and high return currencies but the Indian Government has its own stand which believes in knowing and exploring more about the cryptocurrency. Overall cryptocurrencies have a long way to go before they can replace credit cards and traditional currencies as a tool for global commerce. People need to be educated about it as many people are still unaware of cryptocurrency. Businesses need to start accepting it so that it can gain wider acceptance. The future appeal of cryptocurrencies lies in allowing our ultimate control over our money, with fast secure global transactions and lower transactions fees when compared to all existing currencies. But the government will have to take considerable steps, given the risk from possible use of cryptocurrencies in terror financing, money laundering and tax evasion.",      
    "Topic85": "Digital India is an initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 2nd July, 2015 with the aim to connect rural areas with high speed internet networks and improving digital literacy. Digital India comprises various initiatives under the single programme, each targeted to prepare India for becoming a knowledge economy and for bringing good governance to citizens through synchronised and coordinated engagement of the entire government This programme has been envisaged and coordinated by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) in collaboration with various Central Ministries/Departments and State Governments. The Prime Minister as the Chairman of Monitoring Committee on Digital India monitors activities under the Digital India initiative. All the existing and on-going e-Governance initiatives have been revamped to align them with the principles of Digital India. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak indirectly helped in enhancing centre's vision of Digital India, as many service providers, including banks and telecom operators have significantly reduced their offline operations and are asking their customers to embrace the digital form for any assistance. The COVID-19 pandemic has played as a catalyst in the growth of digital payment platforms in India, with more number of people adopting e-transaction modes.  In fact, companies have witnessed addition of a high number of new users of digital payment gateways during this time. There are certain services associated with Digital India Programme. These include (i) It is a facility that will help citizens to digitally store their important documents like Pan card, passport, marksheets and degree certificates. Digital locker will provide secure access to government issued documents (ii) A platform to share inputs and ideas on matters of policy and governance. It is a platform for citizen engagement in governance, through a 'Discuss', 'Do' and 'Disseminate approach. (iii) It is being used by people and government organisations for achieving the goals of Swachh Bharat Mission, e-sign framework allows citizens to digitally sign a document online using Aadhaar authentication. (iv) The application provides important services such as online diagnostic reports, enquiring availability of blood online etc. (v) It is a one-step solution for end to end scholarship process right from submission of student application, verification, sanction and disbursal to end beneficiary for all the scholarships provided by the Government of India. (vi) e-Sampark - It is a mechanism to contact citizens electronically, sending informational and public service messages via e-mails, SMS and outbound dialing. (vii) Digital India Platform (Deity) - Deity has undertaken an initiative namely Digitise India Platform (DIP) for large scale digitisation of records in the country that would facilitate efficient delivery of services to the citizens Policy initiatives have also been undertaken (by Deity) in the e-Governance domain like e-Kranti Framework, Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software for Government of India, Framework for Adoption of Open Source Software in e-Governance Systems etc. (viii) Bharat Net - Another initiative taken in this regard includes Bharat Net, a high speed digital highway to connect all 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats of the country BSNL has introduced Next Generation Network (NGN) which is an IP based technology to manage all types of services like voice, data, multimedia/ video and other types of packet switched communication services. (ix) BPO Policy This policy has been approved to create BPO centres in different North-Eastern states and also in smaller towns of other states Electronics Development Fund (EDF) Policy aims to promote Innovation, R and D and Product Development to create a self-sustaining eco-system of Venture Funds. (x) National Centre for Flexible Electronics (NCFlexE) is an initiative of Government of India to promote research and innovation in the emerging area of Flexible Electronics. (xi) National Agriculture Market (NAM) - It a Pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. (xii) International Support - In the month of April 2019, Google provided free Wi-F at 500th station in India, one of the largest public Wi-Fi networks in the world. Microsoft also provides broadband connectivity to five hundred thousand villages in India and makes India its cloud hub through Indian data centres The programme has been favoured by multiple countries including the US, Japan, South Korea, UK, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. (xiii) e-cabinet Inspired by the developments of a Digital India, taking a step further, the Andhra Pradesh government has launched the first paperless digital cabinet, known as e-cabinet, in India. The ministers can access the entire agenda of cabinet meetings via an application. (xiv) Digital Unlocked - It is an initiative by Google in collaboration with the Indian School of Business and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to promote digital awareness and to help small scale businesses to go digital. (xv) Social Endeavour for Health and Telemedicine (SEHAT) - It is a health initiative in India launched by the government to offer telemedicine in rural areas where people can consult doctors online and order telemedicines. One of the most successful outcomes of the Digital India initiative has been the runaway success of Jandhan Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) initiative, which has provided a digital identity to more than a billion Indian citizens as well as access to the banking system to millions of Indians who were earlier excluded from the formal economy. The government's Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme now caters to around 350 million Indians liberating them from bureaucratic impediments, while ensuring that process leakages are a thing of the past. Following the success of DET initiative, efforts are underway to provide more public services online, in an 'anytime, anywhere mode, thus, converting the ubiquitous mobile phone into an instrument of economic and social empowerment as well as access to livelihoods and information. In the realm of digital literacy, the government's Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) has ambitions of making 60 million Indians digitally literate and it is anticipated that this programme will attain greater traction in the days ahead. Though, the achievements of the programme have been commendable, it continues to face multiple challenges in successful implementation due to lack of clarity in policies and infrastructural bottlenecks The major challenge faced by Digital India are (1) The issues pertaining to taxation and other regulatory guidelines have proved to be roadblocks in advancing with the programme Some of the common policy hurdles include lack of clarity in FDI policies, which have impacted the growth of e-commerce. (2) Digital Divide A study has observed that for Digital India to have a large scale impact on citizens across the nation, the digital divide needs to be addressed through last mile connectivity in remote rural areas, as currently. Over 55,000 villages remain deprived of mobile connectivity. This is largely due to fact that providing mobile connectivity in such locations is not commercially viable for service providers. (3) Poor Connectivity Various reports have estimated that India needs over 30 lakh hotspots as against the availability of about 31,000 hotspots at present to reach global level of one wi-fi hotspot penetration for every 150 people. Fear of cybercrime and breach of privacy has been a deterrent in adoption of digital technologies. Most of the technology including cyber security tools is imported from countries such as China. There is no sufficient skill to inspect for hidden malwares. India needs 1 million trained cyber security professionals by 2025. The current estimated number is 62000. The technological revolution in India has benefitted the already privileged class of Indians. It is also difficult to scale up initiatives involve all Indians, as fundamental attitudinal and institutional change is still an issue. The governments must find solutions for the specific political-social context of the nation and technology must be accompanied by significant changes in policy and institutions in order to have meaningful impact. The Digital India Movement is a giant technological leap which is lubricating the wheels of India's economy during this crisis situation. This shift is bound to drive India's digital mission. Remote working and e-services have become the new norm. This digital transformation will further aid in fulfilling India's Digital Mission. The programme will generate huge number of IT, Telecom and Electronics jobs, both directly and indirectly. Success of this programme will make India Digitally empowered and the leader in usage of IT for the delivery of services related to various domains such of health, education, agriculture, banking etc.",      
    "Topic86": "The term 'globalisation' means integration of economies and societies through cross country flow of information, ideas, technologies, goods, services, capital, finance and the people. The essence of globalisation in a broad sense is connectivity in all aspects of human life. Although, economic forces are an integral part of globalisation, it would be wrong to suggest that they alone produced it. It has been driven forward above all by the development of information and communication technologies that have intensified the scope and speed of interaction between the people all over the world. India became independent as one of the poorest countries of the world. The British colonial rule had destroyed the self-sufficient agrarian economy. The then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru preferred mixed economy for planned economic development of the country. As a result of this, public sectors were set up along with the number of private enterprises, but like the socialistic model of economy, the mixed economy of India did not produce profitable results. A number of public sectors became sick and the growth rates of production began to fall. While the poverty of the people continued to grow at an alarming rate, there was an acute balance of payment crisis and due to low domestic savings, there was no adequate capital for investment. There was also the shortage of resources to provide educational and health facilities to a large growing population. Moreover, there was high rate of inflation and the balance of payment deficit was around $10 bn. In such a situation, PV Narsimha Rao government was compelled to introduce the policy of liberalisation, privatisation and Dr Manmohan Singh, the then Finance Minister played an instrumental role in the adoption of New Economic Policy (1991) In the midst of all these developments, globalisation was adopted by Indian Government during 1990-91 when Indian economy was in a very bad shape. It was, however, adopted not as a solution to deteriorating Indian economy but to enable itself to get further foreign exchange loans from World Bank as its foreign exchange reserves were reduced to mere 3 weeks outflow. To rectify its ailing financial health, government simultaneously decided to amend its economic policies and go for privatisation and liberalisation of its economy. These decisions had immediate positive effect. However, globalisation has proven to be double edged weapon. It did help government temporarily meet its urgent need of foreign exchange but it has, as a by-product, caused some permanent damage to Indian economic system and Indian social structure. For thousands of years, different countries have been doing trade with one another. But the process has got a tremendous boost in about last two decades. Due to high handed policies of International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organisation who have been working on the agenda of developed countries like USA. With the opening of Special Economic Zones, the availability of new jobs has been quite effective. There has been a considerable rise in employment. The foreign companies brought in highly advanced technology with them and this helped to make Indian industry more technologically advanced. There is an International Market for companies and for consumers there is a wider range of products to choose from. Increase in flow of investments has been used for economic reconstruction. Globalisation has intensified interdependence and competition between economics in the world market. This is reflected in interdependence in trading of goods and services. As a result, domestic economic developments are not determined entirely by economic policies and economic conditions Rather they are influenced by both domestic and international policies and economic conditions. This constrained the policy option available to the government which implies loss of autonomy to some extent in decision making at the National level. Apart from these positive aspects, there are some negative developments also which are attributed to globalisation process only. Due to the interdependence of Indian economy and world economy, it has become very difficult for the Government of India to insulate its economy from the world economy. Indian people now prefer global brands over Indian brands because they are cheap, more fashionable and easily available. Steep and fast products in custom duties have snatched large part of Indian market from Indian industry and passed it on to imports from established global players. For its face of global competition, Indian industry has transformed itself from labour intensive to capital intensive by adopting global technologies and automatic machinery, which has resulted in the high rate of unemployment in India. Improved economic conditions, increased recognition of human rights, unprecedented mobility and interaction of people from different countries have dental local cultures of people the world over. India is not an exception in this Indian family system is shifting towards nuclear family system instead of the joint family system. These nuclear families are getting further divided due to strained relations of Partner Old and handicapped persons in the families are being forced to support themselves without any support from their children. Globalisation has undermined the traditional role of women in homemaking farming, handicrafts, handlooms etc., and resulted in a relatively better environment for women. Today, women are working in all spheres of Indian economy and are enjoying the fruits of 'empowerment process' brought in by globalisation. At the same time, their security has become a major issue in this changing scenario and they are bearing the double burden of family as well as that of the job because the role of men in India has not changed much People today, especially the young, have developed an identity that gives them a sense of belonging to a worldwide culture, which includes an awareness of events, practices, styles and information that are a part of the global culture. There is the development of a bicultural identity or a hybrid identity, which means that part of one's identity is rooted in the local culture while another part stems from an awareness of one's relation to the global world. We cannot say that the impact of globalisation has been totally positive or negative. It has been both. However, it becomes a point of concern when, an overwhelming impact of globalisation can be observed on the Indian culture. Every educated Indian seems to believe that nothing in India is to be approved unless recognised and recommended by an appropriate authority in the West. This should be checked in order to preserve the rich cultural diversity of India and to ensure the fulfilment of the principle of self-sufficiency.",
    "Topic87": "In the present digital world where internet has become more important and it is being integrated into industrial and defence related networks around the globe, it has become increasingly important to focus on cyber warfare networks Cyber warfare uses internet as a weapon against the enemy state without having any physical presence and thus making it one of the most deadly weapon to be used in the 21st century. The contemporary states are using the internet as a foreign policy tool. The internet, powered by satellites and undersea cables has become more relevant in aiding national security, such as in the development of remote radars and national security communication systems. The use of internet in an integrated and connected world has made it possible to attack the enemy nation with the click of a keyboard key. Thus, the internet forms the basis of cyber warfare in the present world. Cyber warfare refers to virtual warfare conducted in the cyberspace through the means of internet and cyber methods. The cyberspace can be described as globally interconnected network of digital infrastructure which involves the information and communications infrastructure such as computer systems, internet and telecommunications network, and digital information transmitting devices that mainly uses internet. Cyber warfare involves agencies that are organised along nation state boundaries, in offensive as well as defensive operations by the use of computers, which are med to attack other computers or networks through electronic means. The impact of cyber warfare varies according to the target and severity Through disrupting networks, the cyber attackers target real world infrastructures such as International airports, power grids etc. The nation states are increasingly getting dependent upon internet networks from financial services to transport networks Dependence on the internet networks has made them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The cyber-attacks can be launched instantly from any distance with no evidence or traces of any path that could be travel back, which makes retaliation much harder. Though cyber-attacks are mainly carried out by non-state individuals but if these attacks are aided by state machinery, they take the form of cyber warfare Cyber warfare involves secret operations over the internet and there is equivalent destruction and damage as in a conventional warfare operation. Cyber warfare can present multitude of threats towards any nation. At the fundamental level, cyber warfare is used to support traditional warfare. But various other modes of cyber warfare also exist. These are (a) Espionage - Cyber warfare techniques are used for espionage where critical information is stolen from the enemy servers via communication networks. Out of all cyber-attacks, 25% are espionage based cyber-attacks where information is related to a country's infrastructure such as transport, power, etc. The cyber attackers steals classified and sensitive data to gain advantage over the rival country. Many of the cyber-attacks use Advanced Persistent Threats (APTS) as their tools to secretly enter networks or systems and remain undetected for years. This gives advantage to the attacking side of initiating an attack whenever it wishes to. (b) Sabotaging - Sabotage attacks are made on useful and strategic infrastructure of a country. Components of military and defence are usually connected and integrated to national level control systems that run via satellite networks Sabotaging is an act of disrupting this important system to undermine military and defence capabilities of a country. In addition to the military infrastructure, other types of infrastructure such as communication networks, power grids, transport networks, fuel and water supplies, port infrastructure as well as coal and nuclear power plants are also at risk of disruption. (c) Denial of Service Attack - Denial of Service (DoS) attack or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended user. These attacks targets services such as banks, financial systems, payment gateways etc. to cause financial disruption and loss to the country. It either consists of buffer overflow attacks which send more traffic to a network address than it can handle. This leads to a crash in the network. When multiple systems are used to cause a synchronised attack to a single target, it is considered as a Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack. It makes the location of attack undetectable. (d) Cyber Propaganda - Cyber warfare also includes cyber propaganda to control information and influence public opinion in a country. It is a form of physchological warfare and it uses social media, fake news and other digital means that are accessible by a large number of people. It is a form of long term warfare and it uses a delibrate, systematic technique to shape perceptions, manipulate minds and change or modify behaviours in a manner that a propagandist would like. (e) Phishing Attacks - A phishing attack sends fake attractive offers to the people in an attempt to obtain financial details. Other form of details such as secret and classified information can be obtained through these attacks To make the attacks more convincing the attacker uses spear phishing that looks more formal as it uses detailed information such as a proposal with a banner, logos, website addresses etc. which makes it easier for the attacker to obtain credible information. Phishing attacks can be used by countries to obtain information from government sources as well as private sources which are providing essential services to the government ministries and departments at the central as well as state levels. The unique nature of cyber warfare presents many challenges that require special mechanisms to cope-up with. These challenges are (a) No Physical Boundaries - The cyberspace has no boundary limitations. It is not bound by geography and time. A cyber-attack can be carried out from thousands of kilometers, without any physical presence. The increasing connectivity makes a cyber-attack possible in any country from any place. Cyber-attacks have also replaced traditional military attacks in several countries. (b) Increasing dependence on Information Technology Networks - Today countries are dependent upon IT networks for banking and finance infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure, electric power distribution systems, energy systems, transport management systems, strategic military and defence systems. This has made countries vulnerable with a single click; the whole of critical infrastructure of a country can be disrupted. (c) No Battlefield - There are no general battlefronts in cyber warfare. It can be carried out from anywhere on any network with the use of World Wide Web and satellite communication. Thus, traditional war techniques are being replaced by cyber war techniques that have potential to create blackouts, rail crashes and disruption at the financial institutions of a country such as the stock exchanges. (d) No Physical Damage - Cyber warfare does not involve any physical strike or damage to any infrastructure. It only involves disruption of systems to create loss to the rival nation. It also makes it difficult to detect a cyber-attack. Several times, it is not even possible to tell whether the disruption was due to a cyber-attack or a systematic fault. (e) Easy to Organise - It only requires a couple of computers with good internet access to organise and launch cyber warfare. Hackers often use tools that are free and simple to operate. It is much cheaper to finance cyber warfare as compared to conventional warfare. (f) Difficult to Trace - The cyber-attacks are very difficult to trace as they do not leave any evidence of any attack. The point of origin cannot be tracked because it is launched by hacking into other computers. Even if the origin is traced, it is not easy to launch a counter offensive. (g) Difficult to Defend - In conventional warfare, there are counter offensive and defensive techniques that are installed in a country's land boundaries but in cyber warfare, there are not any defensive systems that could be installed to defend against a cyber-attack. Thus, it makes the cyber-attack more complex and difficult to defend. At present, there are no rules of engagement either at the national or international level. Thus, cyber space warfare has remained a borderless and complex entity that has the potential to create more damage than even the traditional military warfare. It is considered as a modem form of warfare that has anonymity as the biggest advantage associated with it. The rapid expansion of cyber war techniques puts the people in developing countries like India at much greater risk. Organisations such as DRDO has developed high grade cryptographic techniques to safeguard Indian networks against internal as well as external attacks Partnerships with the private sectors is an essential step as majority of country's cyber assets are controlled by entities outside the government. There is an urgent need to train more cyber security experts so that Indian cyber space can be made more secure. India is fortunate to have an expert talent pool, which can be employed to make India free from surprise threats.", 
    "Topic88": "Human beings have always strived for a disease free life. We have achieved great scientific progress through which it is now possible to alter the fundamental genetic code of life. It has enabled us to modify genomes of all types of living creatures, including animals, plants, and even humans. The Gene editing technology, also known as Genome editing or Genome engineering is a technique through which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism. The gene editing techniques affect different areas such as disease management, biomedical research, agricultural and environmental research, etc. Gene editing has transformed research and human disease cures. Agricultural scientists are interested in the technology's potential to edit crops so that they can be made much more nutritious as well as drought resistant. Significant improvements have also been made in gene editing which has made it more precise. Various harmful species of pests have been eliminated without altering ecological balance. In future it might make it possible to eliminate harmful disease affecting humans that will reduce human sufferings. It will also prove effective in de-extinction efforts and may also create new and healthier foods that will reduce hunger and malnutrition. Thus, it has huge potential that could make the world a better place to live. The editing of genetic material is done using CRISPR-Cas 9 technology, also known as molecular scissors. It is a dynamic and precise tool that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA at any location and potentially repair or alter defective genes. It is used to remove, add or alter specific DNA sequences in the genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that introduce changes in the DNA. These are (i) Cas 9 - It is an enzyme that can cut the DNA strands at specific locations so that the desired bits of DNA can be added or removed to obtain desired results. (ii) Guided RNA - This is a small piece of pre-designed RNA sequence located within a longer RNA which binds to DNA and guides the Cas 9 enzyme towards the right part of the genome. It makes sure that the Cas 9 enzyme cuts the DNA at a precise point. The RNA guide is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence in the DNA. The RNA guide has RNA bases that are complementary to the target DNA sequence. This means that guided RNA will bind to the target s only. The Cas9 enzyme follows the guide RNA and makes cut in the DHA. At this stage, the cell recognises that DNA is damaged and tries to repair through mutation for decades, the scientists used chemicals or radiations cause mutations. However, there was no way of controlling where in the genome the mutation would occur. The CRISPR-Cas 9 technology has given them a versatile tool to edit the gene wherever they desire to The CRISPR Cas 9 method is the most reliable and cheapest tool to cut and paste DNA specific points. The CRISPR clustered regularly interspaced short Palindromic repeats, were discovered in genomes of prokaryotes such as E. coli Bacteria in 1987 by Japane scientist Yoshizumi Ishino But, its use was successfully demonstrated in 2012 by a group of scientists who discovered that by designing guide RNA to target a specific region in the genome, the CRISPR Cas 9 system can be used as a cat and paste tool to modify genomes. Since then, it has been used to seamlessly cut and paste DNAs to switchoff trouble making genes. It was recognised that Ecoli bacteria has a built-in gene editing system that they respond to invading pathogenes such as viruses. Using the CRISPR, the bacteria cut the part of virus DNA and keep a bit of it behind to help them recognise and defend against the virus the next time it attacks. Scientists adapted this system so that it could be used in other cells from animals, plants, humans etc. The CRISPR gene editing technology has been used for various purposes to make human lives better. The CRISPR technology has enabled humans to experiment with newer techniques as the technology for editing genes has come far. The gene editing technology has following applications. Gene editing has resulted in improvements in agriculture all over the world. It has improved plant yields, crop quality and enabled us to make more disease resistant and better quality crops. It has enabled us to domesticate wild crops that are useful for eradicating hunger and malnutrition. Using this tool, a large number of crop varieties have been cultivated that have improved agricultural performance. There have been sweeping changes to agricultural technologies in breeding. This technique has the potential to create plants that are disease free. With climate change, the world requires more crops that can tolerate a wide range of weather conditions Gene editing has the potential to create such crop varieties. CRISPR gene editing tool has been used to deliver perio genetic models for fundamental disease research, drug screening and therapy development. There have been improvements in rapid diagnostics, in-vivo editing and correction of heritable conditions. It also holds potential in treating various complex conditions such as cancer, tuberculosis as well as HIV infections. The genetic research is currently focussed on single gene disorders such as systic fibrosis, haemophilia and sickle cell disease. Scientists are working to boost the functions of immunity T-cells so that immune systems can detect and kill the cancer cells. Medical Treatment Gene editing technologies have potential to alter disease causing genes and treat severe medical conditions. Researchers have been able to edit genes in human embryo to try to correct a faulty gene which caused an inherent blood disorder. It was not accepted to the scientific community due to ethical and moral concerns but it has showed that gene editing technologies have huge potential in resolving issues and diseases that have been plaguing the human civilisation for long periods. The removal of faulty gene and cure of hereditary diseases has been proven to be a blessing for even the future generations of children. This also will lead to lower incidence of diseases in the world. Manufacturing Cleaner Biofuels CRISPR gene editing technology has been used to alter gene of algae with high biofuel yield. This has enabled the researchers to double the yield of biofuel from the algae. The oil has been processed in existing refineries and used like a conventional fuel. This has enabled the researchers with a new tool to fight global warming through the use of more environment friendly and less degrading fuels. Gene editing has the potential to solve Global energy crisis. Developing New Drugs and more effective drugs and medicines can be made using gene editing technology. These medicines can be used to treat heart diseases, blood disorders so that these diseases can be completely eliminated from human species. Many partnerships have been made with pharmaceuticals companies to develop modern age drugs to cure existing disease and cure future diseases in humans. Several issues are associated with gene editing. Issues with GM Crops Genetically modified crops have higher yields and better nutrition but concerns related to GM crops have not been addressed properly. These foods have been said to create allergic reactions in many people and thus their efficacy has not been tested fully on people of all ages, genders etc. Issues have also been highlighted in various researches that CRISPR Cas 9 edited agricultural crops are also said to have triggered cancer in various people. In India where there is a diversity of races having different genetic composition, issues related to the effects of GM crops on these diverse people should be addressed. Gene editing technology has been used to carry out illegal experiments by editing genes and creating 'designer babies'. These experiments do not have certificates and authorisation from the scientific medical community. These experiments are not certified and may cause M potential harm to the gene edited embryo. Altering human being genes without any approved technique may have unintended consequences for human lives. Though there are no guidelines on editing genes in human embroys but scientific community has evolved a general consensus that clinically gene editing should not be used on human embroys for experimentation. Through gene editing technology, wealthy parents can afford to edit the genes of their offsprings and lead to genetic haves and have nots. It would lead to greater inequality than the present world already lives with. This could also lead to genetic discrimination among the poor and the rich. Thus, inequality will be established opposite to what the technology is to be used for. Germline editing means changing the genes passed on the children and future generations, creating genetically modified people. The changes made in germline would be passed on to future generations, thus, passing on the modifications to even new people that would be added to the current generation. Germline modification has been considered and socially unacceptable. It would lead to random mutations, extrapolation of the genetic changes, harmful consequences for the future generations, negative impact of social perception among the members of the society. Gene editing has taken technological innovations to newer levels. A lot of progress is still to be made as technological and ethical hurdles still stand between humans and the use of genome editing applications. Experiments and tests should be so that it is subject to appropriate scrutiny by the regulators and their use must be controlled to prevent commercial misuse. While scientists are still working to determine whether the gene editing is safe and effective for use of the people, the current application of the technology must be regulated for safe use. It must be remembered that any technology is for the betterment of humankind. It must be ensured that social concerns are addressed before the use of gene editing. The government, private sector and scientific community must work together to make gene editing safe for use.", 
    "Topic89": "Modern medical therapies are capable of miracles that humans have sought to solve problems of their lives. Stem cell research has also opened up a wide range of opportunities for medical sciences. Using stem cells, damaged tissues and organs can be replaced, new drugs can be safely tested and opportunities can be created in research for genetic defects and even cancer. It has wide potential is healthcare for curing different types of diseases and improving the state of human body in general. Stem cells provide new cells for the body as it grows, and can replace specialised cells that are damaged or lost. They have unique properties to carry out cell division again and again to produce a new cell and as they divide, they can change into other types of cells that make up the human body. The term ‘stem’ cell was coined by Theodor Boveri and Valentin Hacker in the late 19th century. But the key properties of stem cells were identified by two scientists in early 1960s at university of Toronto. They did a pioneering work by using bone marrow cells in mice. The first therapy wing stem cells was a bone marrow transplant performed by French Oncologist in 1958 on five workers who were critically affected by accident. These workers survived. In the year 1981, embroyonic stem cells were first isolated and successfully cultured using mouse blastocysts by two British Biologists. In 1998, scientists were able to derive stem cells from Human embryos and grow stem cells in a laboratory. These cells were known as Human Embryonic stem cells. In 2006, mother breakthrough was achieved that allowed the scientists to reprogram adult cells genetically so that they can be converted into stem cells. The biology of these mysterious cells is yet to be understood and lot more research is needed before new therapies using stem cell can be applied. There are several types of stem cells that can be used for different purposes. Embryonic stem cells are derived from human embryos that are 3 to 5 days older. They are harvested during a process known as Invitro fertilisation. This involves fertilising an embryo in a laboratory instead inside the female body Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent stem cells which means that they can give rise to virtually any other type of cells in the body. Stem cells come from developed tissues and organs in the body. They are used by the body to repair and replace damaged tissues in the same area in which they are found. Hematopoietic stem cells are type of stem cells found in the bone marrow. They can make new red blood cells, white blood cells, and other type of blood cells Doctors have been performing stem cells transplants for decades using the Hematopoietic stem cells. Adult stem cells cannot differentiate into as many other types of cells as embryonic stem cells can. Adult stem cells can be converted into pluripotent stem cells. These new type of cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells. They can turn into any type of specialised cells in the body which meant that they can potentially produce new cells for any organs and tissues Scientists reprogram the adult stem cells so that they can be used an embryonic stem cells. These cells can be turned into islet cells to treat diabetes, blood cells to create new blood which is free of cancer cells, or peurons to treat neurological disorders. It is a ground breaking discovery which can become the foundation for the new regenerative medicine in humans for treating a dysfunctional organ or any tissues. Cord blood stem cells are harvested from the umbilical cord after childbirth. These cells can be frozen in cell banks for use the future. They have been used to treat various life threatening diseases but more research is required to understand the potential use of these cells. Stem cells are important in medical research for many reasons. They have high potential applications in following areas. Stem cells are used to understand the developments of complex organisms from a fertilised egg. It can be easily identified that how does stem cells become increasingly specialised, making skins, bones, brain and other cell types. Serious medical conditions such as cancer, birth defects can be understood in a better way. Stem cells are used to replace damaged cells and treat diseases. Stem cell therapy can be used to treat extensive skin burns, and to restore the functioning of blood systems in patients with Leukaemia and other blood disorders. These cells can be used to replace the cells lost in many life threatening diseases for which currently there are no suitable cures. If stem cells can be directed to differentiate into specific cell types, various diseases such as stroke, heart disease, diabetes can be cured. Stem cells are used to test new medical treatments, new medicines can also be created by testing their safety on humans rather than animal based testing. The cells can be modified to model various types of diseases in the laboratory and get a better understanding of what goes wrong while curing the diseases Causes of genetic defects can be easily understood with the help of stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells can be used to create an unlimited supply of cells, tissues or even organs that could be used to restore functions without the requirement for toxic immunosuppressants. Several types of transplantation such as Bone marrow transplantation could become more safe and cost effective. Growth and transplant of tissues such as skin, heart, nervous system etc. can be carried out with ease. Stem cells can be used for treating immuno-deficiency diseases. These diseases are characterised by an unusual susceptibility to infection and often associated with anaemia, arthritis, diarrhea etc. The transplantation of stem cells could result in restoration of immune functions and effective normalisation of life span and quality of life for these people. Mental diseases can be cured effectively with stem cells. Diseases such as Parkinson's can be cured by treating brain cells that are specifically causing the disease to emerge. Human clinical experiments have demonstrated the potential effectiveness of this approach to treatment. Stem cell treatment is essentially a new type of therapy, the consequences of which have not been sufficiently investigated hence the reliability of stem cell therapy is not yet established It is subjected to following challenges. The cost and production of stem cells is still being debated. As it is a newer therapy, it would be resulting in inequalities where the rich can afford these therapies whereas the poor people cannot. It is not yet clear from where the stem cells can be commercially produced and used for research on a large scale and treatments. Currently, the stem cells experimental practises are used without any preliminary verification of efficacy of those practises. Many cases have shown that the experiments based on stem cell treatments have been riskier and ineffective, even putting lives on the line. .There is currently poor standardisation and regulation of stem cell therapies. Thus, different kinds of results are differently interpreted by various scientists. Lack of standardisation also results in practical hurdles in applying the results successfully to patients. Stem cell therapies also have moral issues. It presents itself with two dilemmas- the duty to prevent or alleviate sufferings or the duty to value human life. To obtain embryonic stem cells, an embryo has to be destroyed. It means destroying a potential human life. But it could also result in discoveries of new techniques that could save human lives or make them better. Thus, this dilemma has to be resolved before applying stem cell treatment. The advancements in science have transformed human lives. Stem cell therapy research is a similar scientific achievement that has the potential to transform human lives. Whether stem cell research can have lifesaving effect on humans is yet to be determined. The current research should be aligned towards the uses of stem cell as to improve human lives and end its miseries. The work of scientists should be driven by public welfare and should not ignore public morality. Any kind of research should respect public sensitivities and public concerns. It is through a broad participation of all stakeholders that the effects of stem cell treatments can be carefully measured, improved and further applied to better treatments for various incurable diseases. Stem cells offer various opportunities as well as various challenges that should be overcome to make it successful and friendly to human life.", 
    "Topic90": "Blockchain technology is an emerging technology that has the potential to improve security in banking, supply chain and other transaction networks. It reduces the risk of fraudulent transactions, save time and eliminate intermediaries It is the safest mode of recording transactions between people. The technology in its present use allows the consumers and suppliers to connect directly, removing any needs of intermediaries. It provides a decentralised database or digital ledger of information that everyone on the network can see. It ensures security as well as transparency. Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to change or alter it. It has opened doors for creating a distributed consensus of digital online world. This allows the participating entities to certainly know that a digital event has occurred. There are disruptive opportunities that have been created by the use of this technology. A Block chain is a digital network that stores various kinds of information. Each block in a blockchain network stores information with the hash of its previous block. A hash is a digital code which belongs to the specific block in the network. If information in any block gets modified, the hash is also modified. The connection of blocks through unique hash keys makes the blockchain secure. A blockchain network makes use of public and private keys in order to form a digital signature which ensures security and transparency. Blockchain allows the participants of network to perform digital verification and reach a consensus to agree on a particular value. While making any transfer, or uploading any information on the blockchain network, the sender uses their private key and announces the transaction on the network. As transaction is made or information is uploaded on the network, the block is created. As information gets created in a network, the block is required to be validated by reaching a consensus. As soon as the information gets validated the block gets verified and is added to existing blockchain. In this way, the updated information is stored securely over the network. The following advantages make the block chain technology attractive for future applications. Decentralised Nature Block Chain is decentralised in nature, meaning that no single person or a group of persons holds the authority of overall network. Everybody in the network has the copy of distributed ledger with them but nobody can modify it on their own, without the consent of people on the network. This approach of blockchain technology allows transparency as well as security to the people in the blockchain network. Decentralisation also allows for independent operation between users rather than being regulated by any authority. Peer-to-Peer Networks Blockchain makes the interaction between two parties easily possible via peer-to-peer network. The P2P protocol enables the people on the blockchain network to hold an identical copy of transactions. There is no requirement of a third party and any transaction can be done without involving any extra charges being paid to any third party that is regulating the network. Permanent Storage of any data can be permanently stored in a blockchain network once any data has been processed, it cannot be changed or altered due to the distributed nature of the ledger. If anyone in the network tries to change the data, they will have to change the hash of the previous blocks because each block contains a hash that is a unique digital address of that particular block. It is extremely complicated for someone to change all the hashes as it requires complicated operations. Hackers also cannot alter the data due to this reason. It becomes easier to detect tampering of any data. Blockchains are tamper proof because changes in one block can be detected and fixed smoothly. As the hash of one block is linked to the next block, in order to tamper with the data, anyone will need to change hash of every block, which makes it impossible to do so. It prevents fraud in financial operations as well as data storage of any kind. If any editing in transactions takes place, it can be easily audited. Accountability Blockchain offers higher degree of accountability to the people because every person on the network is able to see what kind of data is being uploaded or updated in the network. The network itself is not reliant upon any third person or any regulator. It removes any error in the uploading of data by creating unalterable ledger or blocks of information. Several core banking platforms are working on blockchain technologies to remove any error in transaction values. Blockchains have been primarily used for cryptocurrencies, which are decentralised currencies that work independently of the Central bank of a country. The nature of blockchain has allowed businesses all over the world to explore technology's potential. The potential use of blockchain are the terms of engagement between two parties involved in any business transaction is signed by them in the forms of agreements or contracts. The paper-based contracts are prone to fraud or errors which affects the trust between parties. Smart contracts are digital contracts that have been made using contract is not met, then the smart contract is automatically deployed. Smart contracts have been used for different industries such as financial agreements, health insurance, real estate property documents etc. Digital Elections offer a potentially safe application in digital elections conducted using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). EVMs are not tamper proof and can be manipulated. But blockchain systems can be used to sto election related data which cannot be manipulated. Chances of any manuale can be eliminated using blockchain technology. Thus, it allows greater reliability choosing our representatives with fairness of the process. In the healthcare Uses Blockchains can be used to store information related to a patient's medical records. When a medical record is made, it can be incorporated into the system using blockchain which provides the patients with a proof that the health record cannot be manipulated or changed. These personal health records can also be stored on the blockchain with private key encryption so they are only accessible by certain individuals. By integrating blockchain into banking system, customers will be able to see their transactions processesed in few minutes rather than days. With the safety of blockchain, banks have the option to safely and securely transact funds between institutions without any fraud, efficiently and in quick time. The banking transactions involve huge costs, but blockchain technology can be used to transact easily without involving any large transaction costs Property Records The process of property records is cumbersome and involves frauds and manipulations. But blockchain can be used to efficiently store property records with ease. The technology has the potential to eliminate the need for physical manual entries which are error prone. Blockchain can be used to store data related to property without any error. Supply Chains Blockchain can be used to store data related to sales and purchases in supply chains. This allows the companies to verify the authenticity of their products. Blockchain is already being used in the food industry to track the path and safety of food through farm to user journey of the food product. Several industries have applied blockchain technology to make their systems more reliable, fast and efficient. But the use of blockchain technology is not free of challenges. Various concerns associated with blockchains are Higher Costs. The cost of blockchain technology is very high for smaller firms. Firms need large amounts of computational power, which requires huge investments in buying hardware as well as software technologies. Speed. The transactions using blockchain technology are slower as compared to the transactions channels. Transactional channels can perform much faster transactions than blockchains. Blockchain technology can be used to perform illegal activities because it is fully encrypted and unregulated. These activities cannot be tracked easily because new blocks will keep adding in the current network. Security and Privacy Identities created in a blockchain network are encrypted. This, along with the decentralised system of blockchain makes it insecure and privacy concerns arise. To drive public acceptance of blockchain networks, privacy and security concerns should be addressed. There are currently no regulations and governing mechanisms for blockchain networks. It reduces government oversight and its impacts on businesses cannot be properly understood and managed if the whole system works outside the existing regulatory structure. Blockchain has immense potential due to its diverse uses and various applications. Different types of problems can be solved with the help of blockchain technology. Blockchain provides security and trustworthiness in several ways. It has been widely claimed that blockchain will revolutionise the business and redefine companies and economies. A blockchain led transition is still years away due to the risks and concerns it poses. Blockchain has the power to transform ways in which people trade, get medical services, transform supply chains, and make technology more accessible and transparent for everyone. It will lead to improvements in people's lives if blockchain's potential are really fetched.", 
    "Topic91": "India being a peace loving country promotes civilian use of clear technology and has devised a strategy to tap this energy source for developmental purposes Thus, India's peaceful ways of using nuclear energy in termed as Indian Cl Nuclear Strategy. Since our Independence our first Prime Minister Pt. Nehru look very vocal stand against nuclear weapons but being aware of its utility, modernist Nehru asserted for its use in national development. Nuclear energy is the energy which is derived from any radioactive material. It can be derived through two processes ie nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Nuclear fission is a process where the nucleus of a radioactive element breaks down and energy is released and on the other hand, nuclear fusion is the process where two elements combine to release energy. The former is a controllable pros and is used in civil nuclear energy. The latter is a process which is difficult to control but produces enormous amount of energy. The nuclear fusion process takes place in the Sun and provides continuous energy to it. India's journey in the field of nuclear energy began with the formation of Department of Atomic Energy in 1954 The aim of Nuclear programme of India was to harness nuclear resources for peaceful purposes. Under the Nuclear Energy Programme of India, an agreement was signed with USA to setup India's first Nuclear Power Station in 1963 at Tarapore in the state of Maharashtra. Tarapore marked the beginning of India's nuclear power development. As an effort to promote nuclear energy, another agreement was signed with Soviet energy Union to setup another nuclear plant at Kudankulam in 1988. In the earlier stages, electricity generation was the primary focus of the India's nuclear programme. From the beginning, India's nuclear energy programme paid priority and attention to indigenous nuclear energy production. India's nuclear weapon program was later started with the Pokhran 1 and Pokhran II tests. For the nuclear energy, the design, development and manufacturing responsibility for power plant equipments were taken up by Indian industries on their own Companies such as BHEL, L&T, Godrej industries took major responsibilities for supply. The year 1974 marked a watershed in India's Nuclear Development Programine India conducted its first nuclear detonation on 18th May, 1974 in Pokhran Range, Rajasthan, Pokhran L coded as the Smiling Buddha', scripted our nation's name in the list of nuclear weapon possessing countries. This was also the first confirmed nuclear test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The soils and sacredness of the Rajasthan once again experienced a clear test in 1998. It was Pokhran II which earned pride and fear from world nations. It consisted of five detonations, of which, the first was a fusion bomb and the remaining four were fission bombs. These nuclear tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of major countries, including Japan and the United States. India's two giant scientific establishments, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the Defense Research Development Organisation (DRDO) began to synergise their strength by 1999, India refined its ability to drop nuclear bombs using combat aircraft by the time, the 1995 tests started and the DRDO and the atomic energy team had made major changes in the bomb. The weight was reduced considerably and the yield was increased. Elaborate safety packages for delivery had been taken care of Missiles were also developed as delivery vehicles. The first nuclear power plant was installed in 1969 in Tarapur, Maharashtra with two units of 160 MW. At present, there are 21 nuclear power plants operational in India By 2050, India aims to supply 25% of electricity from nuclear sources. India's Nuclear Power Programme was conceived as a three stage cycle as envisaged by Dr Homi Bhabha. The first stage was the Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) utilising natural uranium to produce electricity. The spent fuel was Plutonium-239 ass by product. The second stage was Fat breeder reactor which used mixed oxide made from by-product of first stage Le Plutonium-239. Fast breeder reactors are the ones which produce more fuel than it consumes. The third stage as envisaged was Thorium and reactor which involved self-sustaining fuel model comprising of Thorium-252 and Uranium-233 as fuel large deposit of Thorium has been discovered in Malabar Coast of India, making it the natural choice of fuel for the third stage. As India is not a signatory to the discriminate Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, due to its weapons programme, it was excluded from trade in nuclear material and nuclear plant technology. This had hampered its civil nuclear strategy till 2009. Since 2009, India's civil nuclear path changed as we signed the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement also known as 123 Agreement. Also, with the support of USA, Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) granted waiver to India to access nuclear material and nuclear technology. In pursuance of the exemption granted to India, the Parliament passed Nuclear Liability Act, 2010. In 2016, India signed Civil Nuclear Agreements with 14 countries to carry out nuclear commerce to be used as fuel for power generation. India also became the member of Missile Technology Control Regime (2018), Wassenaar Agreement (2017) and Australia Group (2018). The inclusion of India has further strengthened the candidature of India as member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). Significance of India's Nuclear Energy Programme India's population has grown from only 350 million to 1.3 billion today. Commercial energy consumption has increased which is fulfilled mainly by coal power and hydropower. India requires a sustainable source of energy for meeting the requirements of its large population. Almost 33% of India's population resides in urban areas of the country that have high energy consumption requirements. This rapid pace of urbanisation combined with increasing industrialisation has pushed up India's energy demands. Such enormous amount of energy supply can be provided effectively with the help of nuclear energy only. Thus, investing on a sustainable basis in the nuclear energy programme becomes more important. Moreover, due to the exhaustible nature of coal, petroleum and natural gas resources for producing India's energy, these are limited in their scope and extent. Hence, nuclear energy programme to produce nuclear energy in a safe manner becomes significant. India has emerged as a global super power. To maintain pace of development, it is important to build a constant and reliable supply chain of nuclear materials. India has succeeded in pushing its nuclear programme in right direction through its political will, bilateral agreements and NSG waiver for nuclear trade. In this regard, India is set to touch new horizon with agenda of development through its nuclear programmes. ", 
    "Topic92": "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of the Government of India founded with a vision to ‘harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research and planetary exploration’. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was formed in 1969. Headquarter of ISRO is located at Bengaluru, Karnataka. Since its inception, ISRO has accomplished 77 launch missions including Scramjet-TD and RLV-TD, 109 spacecraft missions including 3 nano-satellites, 1 micro-satellite and 2 Re-entry missions. ISRO has also launched 319 foreign satellites till date. In a historic decision, the Union Government on 24th June, 2020 opened India's space programmes for private players. The Cabinet approved the newly formed Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACE), which will act as an arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), IN-SPACE will be functional in six months and will provide level playing field to private companies in the country's space programmes. In-Space, in consultation with ISRO, will also guide and promote the private companies in their endeavour in space activities after assessing their needs and demands. India started its journey to space with the formation of Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962 with Dr Vikram Sarabhai at its centre. INCOSPAR set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in Thiruvananthapuram for upper atmospheric research. Dr Vikram Sarabhai provided the necessary direction to ISRO in its nascent stage. ISRO then embarked on its mission to provide the Nation space based services and to develop the technologies to achieve the same independently. ISRO has listed following in its mission statement, Design and development of launch vehicles and related technologies for providing access to space. Design and development of satellites related technologies for Earth observation, communication, navigation, meteorology and space science. Indian National Satellite (INSAT) programmes for meeting telecommunication, television broadcasting and developmental applications. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) programme for management of natural resources and monitoring of environment using space based imagery .Space based applications for societal development. Research and development in space science and planetary exploration. Throughout the years, ISRO has upheld its mission of bringing space to the service of the common man, to the service of the nation. In the process, it has become one of the six largest space agencies in the world. Brief timeline of some of the successful missions of ISRO are as follows, the first Indian Satellite, Aryabhatta was launched in 1975. It provided the means of using space communications system for TV broadcasting. It led to creation of project Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE). It was a one-year programme covering Indian villages and districts. The main purpose of SITE was to experiment usage of satellite broadcasting to educate the masses. In 1977, Satellite Telecommunication Experiments Project (STEP) was launched using satellite technology to enhance domestic communication SLV-3 placed Rohini satellite in orbit, thereby making India the sixth member of an exclusive club of space-faring nations. The first indigenously created satellite vehicle was launched from Sriharikota range in Andhra Pradesh in 1980. Indian National Satellite System (INSAT), the largest domestic communications system in the Asia Pacific was launched in 1983. INSAT was commissioned to work on broadcast, telecom, meteorology and rescue. The first Indo-Soviet manned space mission was launched in 1984. Rakesh Sharma flew in the Soviet rocket Soyuz T-11, as part of a three member Soviet-Indian crew. The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASIV) programme launched in 1987 which supported a large payload with four developmental flights First lunar mission was launched by ISRO in 2008 using the spacecraft named Chandrayaan that discovered a large number of water molecules on Moon. In 2014, Mangalyaan, India's first interplanetary mission was launched. The successful accomplishment made the ISRO fourth space agency in the world to reach Mars. It was recognised as the least expensive Mars mission. In 2017, ISRO launched 104 satellites in a single rocket (PSLV-C37), thus, setting a world record. Further, ISRO also launched its heaviest rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), placing a communications satellite GSAT-19 in its orbit. With this launch, ISRO became capable of launching 4 tonne heavy satellites. In 2019, ISRO conducted its second lunar mission through Chandrayaan-2 mission with an aim to land on the lunar surface. Although, attempt to soft land on the lunar surface failed, the mission was mostly successful in achieving its objective. So far, ISRO has undertaken 3 inter-planetary missions which are Chandrayaan-I (2008) Chandrayaan-1 was India's first mission to the Moon The robotic lunar exploration mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor called the Moon Impact Probe. Chandrayaan-1 mission was successful Moon Impact Probe was successful in discovering water on the Moon. Mangalayaan (2013) The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) or Mangalayaan launched into Earth's orbit on 5th November, 2013, by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It entered Mars orbit on 24th September, 2014. India became the first country to enter Mars orbit in its first attempt. Chandrayaan-II (2019) was the second mission to the Moon. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV-MkIII) on 22nd July, 2019. It consisted of a lunar orbiter, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan lunar rover which were indigenously developed in India. Chandrayaan-II mission was the first mission meant to explore the lunar South Pole region. Another objective of the Chandrayaan-Il mission was to demonstrate ISRO's ability to soft-land on the lunar surface and operate a robotic rover on the surface. However, the soft landing of Vikram lander could not be accomplished. The lunar orbiter was efficiently positioned in an optimal lunar orbit, extending its expected service time from one year to seven years. Future plans of ISRO include the development of a Unified Launch Vehicle (ULV), development of a reusable launch vehicle, human spaceflight, controlled soft lunar landing, interplanetary probes and a solar spacecraft mission. The core objective of a ULV is to design a modular architecture that could eventually replace the PSLV, GSLV Mk I/II and LVM3 with a single family of launchers. Thirty (30) Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs) and ten (10) Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicles (GSLV MK III) rockets are targeted to be in space by 2022. There will be another attempt for soft landing on moon by late 2021, but without an orbiter in its mission named Chandrayaan 3. ISRO plans to carry out a mission to the Sun by the year 2022. The probe is named Aditya-L1 and will have a mass of about 400 kg. It is the first Indian space-based solar coronagraph to study the corona of the Sun in visible and near-IR bands ISRO will also fly Indian astronauts into space for the first time on board 'Gaganyaan' mission by 2022. Gaganyaan is an Indian crewed orbital spacecraft intended to be the formative spacecraft of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. ISRO has contributed to space science and science education in the country. Various dedicated research centres and autonomous institutions for remote sensing astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space sciences in general function under the aegis of Department of Space. Since India has opened up its space industry for private players, it is a first ever step in the same direction as NASA went long back and is now the biggest space agency in the world with its budget running into billions. Future readiness is the key to maintaining an edge in technology and ISRO endeavours to optimise and enhance its technologies as the needs and ambitions of the country evolve. Thus, ISRO is moving forward with the development of heavy lift launchers, human spaceflight projects, reusable launch vehicles, semi-cryogenic engines, Single and Two Stage to Orbit (SSTO and TSTO) vehicles, development and use of composite materials for space applications, etc.", 
    "Topic93": "India's space mission seeks to harness space technology for national development In this regard, India's space programme took a giant leap when Chandrayaan-2 mission in a bid to land on lunar surface was attempted. Chandrayaan-2 was a follow-up mission to Chandrayaan-1, which was launched in October 2008 and orbited around the moon for 312 days till August, 2009, it discovered water in the form of ice in various parts of the moon, which was a path-breaking discovery in the world of space science. It also discovered minerals such as magnesium, aluminium and silicon on the lunar surface Chandrayaan-2 was launched to further explore the lunar surface. Thus, the objective of the Chandrayaan-2 mission was to explore and perform studies in the South Pole region of the moon which had not been explored previously. The mission consisted of a lunar orbiter, lander and rover. One of the objectives of Chandrayaan-2, was to demonstrate the ability to soft-land on the lunar surface and operate a robotic rover on the surface. Its scientific goals included studies of lunar topography, availability of minerals and water in the form of ice. The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft included three components: a lunar orbiter, the Vikram lander and the Pragyan lunar rover, all of which were indigenously designed and developed. The Lunar orbiter carried eight scientific instruments, which includes a high resolution camera for finding a hazard free spot for the lander and other equipment for mapping the lunar surface for presence of minerals as well as the presence of water in the form of ice. It has an electric power generation capability of 1000 watts and a weight of 2379 kg. Its life is expected to be more than seven years. The Vikram lander had to detach from the orbiter and descend to a low lunar orbit of 30 km x 100 km by using its main engines. It was to then perform a comprehensive check of all its on-board systems before attempting a soft landing that would have deployed the rover and enabled it to perform scientific activities for approximately 14 Earth days. It had the capability to communicate with Earth as well as with the Orbiter and Rover. It had all the equipment to select a suitable landing site and slow down its speed to enable a soft landing. However, it failed to slow down sufficiently to enable the Pragyan rover to carry out its work of exploring the lunar surface. The lander had an electric power generation capability of 650 watts and a weight of 1471 kg, which included the rover having weight of 27 kg. The Pragyan lunar rover was a 6-wheeled robotic vehicle which could travel a distance of upto 500 metres for exploring the moon's surface. It also had an electric power generation capability of 50 watts. It was capable to communicate with the lander. Its primary objective was to identify and determine the abundance of elements near the landing site. The mission was launched on a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III), popularly known as Bahubali, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, on Sriharikota Island on 22nd July, 2019. It is primarly designed to launch communication satellites in Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). Initially, the spacecraft was placed in Earth's orbit for a while; its orbit was raised using on-board propulsion over the next 22 days. After 29 days from its launch, the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 20th August, 2019. After performing a lunar orbit insertion operation, it was placed into an elliptical orbit that passes over the polar regions of the Moon. This was followed by separation of the lander from the orbiter on 2nd September, 2019. After selecting a suitable landing site, the lander separated from the orbiter on 6th September, 2019. In 15 minutes, communication with the lander was lost, as it had made a 'hard' landing due to a software glitch. Importance of Chandrayaan-2 Mission for India Even though the mission has not completed all its stated objectives yet it has boosted the national pride of India. It will motivate the youth to develop scientific temper and undertake real life applications of science and technology. The mission is going to improve the understanding of the Moon and benefit India as well as the whole humanity. It will also provide a push to the home grown indigenously developed space technology that will be critical to future launches and technology missions. It is crucial for inculcating a spirit of scientific temper, innovation and higher standards of manufacturing in India's space sector. ISRO's partnership with the Indian startups in the space sector such as Team Indus' will also nurture space startups in India. Chandrayaan-2 has brought the importance of Moon missions in the limelight. These missions are not only capable of fetching economic benefits but also further scientific advancements. For instance, various Moon missions, including Chandrayaan-1 mission, have discovered water on the lunar surface. Mineral resources have also been discovered by various Moon missions. Organisations working in space technology are also exploring the aspects of lunar settlements In addition to this ambitious venture like Chandrayaan-2 by India has definitely inspired the world. After the successful launch of the rocket carrying the Chandrayaan-2 into orbit, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the USA lauded Chandrayaan-2, saying India's Moon mission has inspired the US space agency, which is keen to jointly explore the Solar system with ISRO. The New York Times newspaper lauded India's 'engineering prowess decades of space development. Its report stated, ‘One of the successes of India's space programme has been its cost-effectiveness. Chandrayaan-2 cost US $ 141 million, a small fraction of what the United States spent on its historic Apollo Moon mission.’ The orbiter is successfully moving round the moon in its designated orbit. It is continuously transmitting data in the form of images to ISRO ground stations through various onboard sensors and cameras. On 30th July, 2020, the terrain mapping camera captures the Sarabhai crater on the North-East quadrant of the Moon. Further Moon missions have been planned by ISRO, with another attempt at a soft landing by 2021, with Chandrayaan-3. The proposed configuration would include a detachable propulsion module, a lander and a rover, but not an orbiter. We hope that this time ISRO will meet with 100% success in the mission.", 
    "Topic94": "Nanotechnology is the engineering of tiny machines. This is done inside Nan personal nanofactories using techniques and tools being developed today to make advanced products. Nanotechnology is the technology of the future and it will aid in a manufacturing revolution. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter, probably the width of three or four atoms. A human hair is about 25000 nanometers wide. So, one can imagine how small these machines will be. The development and progress in artificial intelligence and molecular technology have spawned this new form of technology ie. Nanotechnology. The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with at talk entitled ‘There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom’ by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) on 29th December, 1959. In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term 'nanotechnology'. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunnelling microscope that could see individual atoms that modern nanotechnology began. Nanotechnology is sometimes called a general-purpose technology because in its advanced form, it will have significant impact on almost all industries and all of society. It will help in creating better built, longer lasting, cleaner, safer and smarter products for the home, communications, medicine, transportation, agriculture and for industry in general. It is more than just mixing nanoscale materials together. It requires the ability to understand and to precisely manipulate and control those materials in a useful way. Nanotechnology involves a new and broad science where diverse fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, material science and engineering converge at the nanoscale. It is also important to understand that nanoscale materials are found in nature For instance, haemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting protein found in red blood cells is 5.5 nanometers in diameter. Naturally occurring nanomaterials exist all around us, such as in smoke from fire, volcanic ash and sea spray. Some nanomaterials are a byproduct of human activity, such as bus and automobile exhaust and welding fumes. To understand its implications, try to imagine a medical device that roams through the human body to find and destroy tiny clusters of cancerous cells before they can spread. Another example is a box of size of a sugar cube that holds the entire contents of a public library, or materials ten times lighter than steel yet ten times stronger. Nanotechology will result in greatly improve efficiency in almost every aspect of life as has been mentioned above. You may recall from the size of the nanoscale page that the nanoscale is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Working at the nanoscale requires an understanding of the various types and dimensions of nanoscale materials Different types of nanomaterials are named for their individual shapes and dimensions. Think of these simply as particles, tubes, wires, films, flakes, or shells that have one or more nanometer-sized dimension. For example, carbon nanotubes have a diameter in the nanoscale, but can be several hundred nanometers long or even longer. Nanofilms or nanoplates have a thickness in the nanoscale, but their other two dimensions can be much larger. The key is to be able to both see and manipulate nanomaterials in order to take advantage of their special properties. As mentioned earlier, the invention of special microscopes gave scientists the ability to work at the nanoscale. The first of these new discoveries was the Scanning tunnelling microscope. While it is mainly designed to measure objects, it can also move tiny objects such as carbon nanotubes. People are doing many different types of work in the field of nanotechnology. Most current work looks at making nanoparticles that have special properties, such as the way they scatter light, absorb X-rays, transport electrical current or heat etc. At the more science fiction' end of the field, are attempts to make small copies of bigger machines or really new ideas for structures that make themselves. New materials are possible with nano size structures and it is even possible to work with single atoms. The nanotechnology initiative in India is a multi-agency effort. The key agencies that have undertaken major initiatives for capacity building are the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Information Technology (DIT) Other agencies that have shown major involvement in the field of nanotechnology are Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) In addition to this, Nanotechnology as a distinctive area of research was started with Nano Science and Technology Initiative (NSTI) in 10th Five Year Plan. Some of the major initiatives in nanotechnology are launch of Nano mission & introduction of PG programmes in Nano Science and Technology. Nanotechnology intervention in mission mode was also introduced in the fields of solar and water technology. Nanotechnology will have both commercial and military uses. It can be used to create powerful weapons and tools of surveillance. So, it comes with benefits and risks. It implies not just better products, but a much improved manufacturing process. With nanotech, building products become as cheap as the copying of files on a computer. This explains why it is sometimes seen as the next industrial revolution'. This technology could give the human race eternal life or it could cause complete destruction. A crew module houses the astronauts and a service module maintains the speed and orientation of the spacecraft using rocket motors apart from the power supply generated from solar cells. ISRO's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mk III, the three-stage heavy lift launch vehicle, will be used to launch Gaganyaan, as it has the necessary payload capability. The technological development of Gaganyaan started in 2006 under the name 'orbital vehicle' where the plan was to design a simple vehicle with a capacity of two astronauts, an endurance of about a week in space and splashdown landing after re-entry. In later years, ISRO has successfully demonstrated some of the technologies required for the mission. In 2007, the Space Capsule Recovery Experiment was launched with an objective of demonstrating the capability to recover an orbiting space capsule, and the technology of an orbiting platform for performing experiments in microgravity conditions. The Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE) conducted in 2014, tested the re-entry technologies envisaged for crew module. Further, the first 'developmental' flight of GSLV MK III in 2017 with higher payload capacity and engine thrust provided impetus for the Gaganyaan mission. Pad Abort Test (PAT) of 2018 was designed to quickly get the crew and spacecraft away from the rocket in the extent of potential failure. ISRO has also finalised the layout and design of Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) which maintains a steady cabin pressure and air composition, removes carbon dioxide and other harmful gases and manages parameters like fire detection and suppression, food and water management. Apart from boosting the culture of research and technology, the proposed mission will provide many benefits: Putting humans in space will have tremendous impact on our medical technologies and understanding of functioning of human bodies For instance, microgravity can lead to weakening of muscle and loss of bone density. Scientists have developed technologies and fitness mechanisms that have been breakthroughs in the treatment of Osteoporosis and maintaining muscle mass. Many of the present advances in medicine were developed through space research such as telemedicine, including miniaturised ultrasound units and remote monitoring system. Similarly, development of laser surgery and robotic surgery were outcome of developing better laser technology as a part of space technology. This mission is also expected to give support to industrial sector as much of the work related to ramping up of infrastructure and supply of hardware for this mission would be outsourced to industry in a major way. This mission is also expected to open up space technologies in various areas as agriculture, water resource management, infrastructure and human resource development. For instance, water purification and sewage recycling can be transformed by adapting such technologies at scale. It will also provide potential for an enormous range of experiments in regard to effects of microgravity and cosmic radiations on bio-organisms ranging from bacteria and plants to large mammals According to ISRO, this mission will help in providing employment to 15,000 people. It will also inspire youth to develop keen interest in science and technology and provide way for international collaborations and policies. India has collaborated with France and Russia to make Gaganyaan mission a success. ISRO and CNES, the French Space Agency, will be combining their expertise in fields of space medicine, astronaut health monitoring, life support, radiation protection, space debris protection and personal hygiene systems. Russia will train Indian astronauts for the country's maiden human spaceflight programme or Gaganyaan mission in addition to providing life support system to the Indian space crew and heating mechanism for the spacecraft. Challenges in the Manned Space Flight After successfully completing the mission to the Moon and Mars, India could potentially become the fourth country to send a man in space, after the erstwhile USSR, the US and China. But to achieve that feat India has to overcome few challenges. The technological challenges involve mastering of the highly complicated and dangerous re-entry and recovery ability. The spacecraft needs to withstand very high temperatures in excess of several thousand degrees. To avoid any disaster, the spacecraft needs to re-enter the atmosphere at very precise speed and angle. Also, the crew escape system needs to be prepared for any emergency from the launch phase onwards and ensure that the reliability of such a system is with zero room for error. Apart from this, the facilities for rigorous and focused training of astronaut, such as centrifuges to experience forces and aircraft to simulate zero gravity conditions are absent in India. Finally, manned missions require huge investment, critics are arguing that money could be used to feed millions of hungry people and children ruffering from malnutrition. It is also argued that those thousands of ISRO scientists and engineers can contribute more by coming up with new technology to fix malnutrition, poverty and sanitation In this regard, sustained financial backup and strong political support is the need of the hour. In the long run to make Gaganyaan a successful mission and turn over a new leaf of research and development, it is necessary that all the stakeholders work vibrantly and with zeal. To ensure a long term commitment for India's human space flight mission, it is necessary to ensure strong political level engagements. Further, the financial implications of the long term project should be assessed and the cost-benefit analysis should be clearly done. To ensure a safe and successful manned space mission, the technological challenges should be overcome. A robust technological framework requires international collaboration and sustained funding is research and development. Also, the procedures and specifications for selecting the astronauts should be rigorous. Thus, such measures will help to make India a successful nation in the league of human spaceflight mission. India has biggest youth population in the world, today they need to be inspired and the manned mission will surely capture the imagination of millions and inculcate scientific temper in the society. The mission will not only bring prestige to the nation but also establish country's role as a key player in the space industry.", 
    "Topic95": "In modern society mobile phones have become an extremely common electronic gadget for many. The growth in the use of mobile phone is based on their ability to become technologically advanced since most of them can take and send photos and videos and connect to the internet for web surfing, studying, meeting their friends, relatives, enjoying and learning etc. However, there are various unfavourable effects of the use of mobile phones in our society. Cell phone radiation has been classified as a possible 'human carcinogen' by WHO. The radiations from mobile could also damage the brain tissue and its effects are more in the children as compared to adults and older people Coupled with technology, in the era of advancement, mobile phones have made our lives easier. We have become dependent upon the mobiles for even carrying out most fundamental functions of our daily life such as communicating, shopping, banking etc. A mobile phone is an electronic wireless, portable scientific device, which is used to receive and send voice and messages. With the advent of smartphones, mobile phones have now got a new meaning. A smartphone can be defined as a phone with touchscreen display, Wi-Fi connectivity, web browsing capabilities and the ability to accept sophisticated apps. Now, they are not only means of communication, but are also the sources of information and entertainment. Telephones have changed dramatically since Alexander Graham Bell spoke the first words into a telephone on 10th March, 1876. In the early 1980s, portable phones were like a small-scale mobile phone. In 1983, Motorola first produced commercially hand held mobile phone (Dyna TAC 8000x). Several other companies started to produce mobile phones. From the First-Generation system (1G), now it has come to the Fifth Generation system (5G). The mobile devices have become the lifeline of communication in today's time. We find ourselves in the midst of the greatest information and communication revolution in human history. More than 40 per cent of world's population has access to the internet because of decreasing prices of smartphone and internet packs. Mobile phones have become so much necessary that human beings have become over dependent on it. In a way, mobile phones have become a constant source of interruptions in our lives. Whether in a family get together, any professional meeting, attending a programme, our mobile phones can ring anywhere. These regular interruptions lead to divided attention and an individual cannot give his best to a single activity he is involved in at that moment. This annoys the other people and lowers the efficiency of the individuals. Mobile phones have dehumanised the dynamics of human contact. The essence of personal touch is lost in today's tech-savvy world. People have confined themselves to the world of mobile and have forgotten how to interact in real life. Addiction to smartphone has significantly impacted the families all over in negative way. Children are increasingly feeling emotionally neglected. Family as institution for inculcating values to children is gradually loosing its relevance. The most affected section of the society by the usage of mobile phones is children. They are spending hours on the mobile phones playing games. This affects their reading time and sleeping hours, also. This also creates havoc with their physical and mental growth. Cell phone emits a type of radiation that is known as Radio Frequency Electro Magnetic Radiation (RF-EMR), also referred to as Microwave radiation. It is highly harmful for children. A large section of teenagers and young people have fallen victims to the use of the mobile phones. The instant messaging and social media applications are very popular among them. Unhindered access to pornographic material, violent uncensored content and extremist radicalised ideologies have negative impact on their mental and physical health. Research has established that the ill effects of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) emitted by mobile phones kills birds, damages bird eggs and embryos. Decreasing number of sparrow and many small species of birds are really alarming. Experts claims that once gone, these birds would never be back. Constant use of mobile phone leads to many risks in our lives also. As it is a source of constant communication, often people are on call and phones while they are walking in the streets or driving h an. These lead to major road accidents which may lead to injuries and even death in many cases. At cognitive level, this is affecting our memory and retention power, we are now increasingly dependent on mobile phones for saving our important data. Because of this habit people are sometimes exploited through data snooping or breaching. However, we cannot deny that mobile phones are great invention and almost a perfect technological breakthrough. It would be unfair if we restrict ourselves to only the negativities of these devices Mobile phones have provided a great level of convenience and safety to those who use it. Apart from the personal use, mobile phones are also considered to be an effective tool in strengthening democracy through better citizen-government interaction, thus influencing the political decision-making process and making governments accountable for their activities. Today mobile phones have become an integral part of our lives. We seem completely reliant on our phones no matter where we are or what we are People these days are empowered to be mobile savvy by staying connected. We can now send/receive e-mails anywhere, easily stay connected, take photos, play games, manage calendars and the list goes on and on. One can also set alarms and reminders, schedule meetings and have video doing conferences through mobile. Besides, a large number of applications help us to do online shopping, get the food delivered at home or office, take care of our health, read books, listen to music, get informations etc. Nowadays, smart mobile devices are used to deliver and take online education. Mobile phones give an opportunity to teachers and students engage with each other without being physically present with each other. It has provided an enhanced opportunity and support to those students who need to study and learn at their own pace. It has given flexibility to both students and teachers. Mobile phones have been used for conducting business and professional meetings and executing projects at a rapid pace. Mobiles have increased the pace of wireless communication among the employees and management. Now the employees are available 24/7 rather than the earlier traditional ways. Meetings can be conducted from anywhere and anytime with the help of mobiles. The instant messaging services help to connect with each other as and when required. The physical distances are now overcome by connecting through mobiles. It is a big support for the people who are living away from their families. They can have a video call with their families as many times as they want to talk to them in a day. The video calls are either free or very affordable. The human dependence on the mobile devices has increased significantly. Technology is good, as long as it is our slave. The day it starts becoming a master it can have serious effects on our life. The increasing cases of nomophobia point towards the latter. We shall not become overdependent on the mobile phones nor should we become a slave to the technologies. Moderation in the use of mobile phone is the key to make ourselves immune from over dependence and addiction. Certain tactical tips like not using phone in bed, getting a real alarm clock, turning off notification while studying and deleting unnecessary apps will be helpful in this direction. Outdoor activities and games need to be promoted. We need to make an optimal use of the mobile devices to reap the maximum benefit out of it. A mobile phone is the most popular and useful gadget in present times. However, a mobile phone could be both positive and negative, depending on how a user uses it. Thus, the mobile phones should be used optimally, according to the needs and requirements of daily life. As mobiles have become a part of our life, so we should use it in a proper way for a better hassle-free life.", 
    "Topic96": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the biggest technological revolution of 21st century, having the potential to disrupt almost all aspects of human existence. Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines based on computer systems. These processes include learning, which is the acquisition of information and rules for using the information, reasoning which is using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions and self-correction. Al has become an essential part of the technology industry. Thanks to virtually unlimited computing power and the decreasing costs of data storage, the world is on the apex of the exponential age of Al, as it learns to unlock the value trapped in vast amounts of data. Al seeks to build machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. It involves some traits to be present in the machines which are knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception, learning, planning and the ability to manipulate and move objects. These human like capabilities are built up with the machine's ability to learn from experience and keep adapting over time. Every application of Artificial Intelligence begins with large amounts of training data. Vastly increased processing power that comes from using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in place of Central Processing Units (CPUs), decreasing cost of storage and the exponential growth in data volumes, together with the emergence of open source platforms, forms a potent combination of technologies and capabilities that provides a very powerful foundation to Al. Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a new factor of production, supplementing the traditional factors of production such as labour, capital and innovation. Al has the potential to overcome the limitations of capital and labour and has the power to open up new sources of value and growth. It has a strong ability to impact the economic growth and drive growth and development through enabling intelligent automation (ability to automate complex task), labour and capital augmentation (enabling humans to focus on their role that adds the most value and complementing human capabilities and improving capital efficiency) and innovation diffusion (driving innovation). Al innovations in one sector has positive consequences in another, as goods, services and innovations that Al will produce. Beyond the economic impact large sectors are interdependent. Economic value is expected to be created from the Al will also have a transformative impact on the greater goods of the Indian society. It will be improving the quality of life and access of choice to a section of the country. Increased access to quality health facilities, inclusive financial growth for large sections of population that have been excluded from formal financial sector, providing real-time advisory to farmers, mitigating the effects of unforeseen factors, building smart and efficient cities and infrastructure to meet the demands of rapidly urbanising population are some of the examples that can be quickly achieved through the use of Al. Al has a great potential to transform the socio-economic system as its impact on every industrial or service sector is indisputable. It will turn the world over a new leaf through automation, intelligence and creation. Thus, it will make few jobs redundant, while it increases the efficiency of other jobs and will create more jobs. As Al progresses, some believe that it will steadily take over large sectors of the workforce and will bring mass-scale unemployment and social unrest. In 2013, a study conducted by Oxford says that as much as 47% of current jobs are at risk of being wiped out. Al will replace the jobs involving repetitive, highly standardised job activities that can be carried out using computer software. Therefore, demand for these positions has been in decline. Al has the potential to automate tasks that are monotonous which gradually mal certain roles obsolete. The examples include activities involved in customer care/call center operation, document classification, discovery and retrieval, content modi on which are based more on technology and less on human work. The transportation sector will witness reduced demand of professional drivers, as fully autonomous cars which are safer, more efficient and more effective will take on the roads. Further, the electronic commerce will see a new wind of change where the importance of salespersons and physical network stores will shrink and the new centres will be fully automated, with robots navigating the space to collect products and execute customer orders, to be then sent or even delivered to customers also automatically, with autonomous drones and/or cars. Also, the support services in a legal context such as document handling, classification, discovery, summarisation, comparison, knowledge extraction and management tasks will also be significantly impacted. Use of Artificial Intelligence in workplace is expected to create 133 million new roles, but cause 75 million jobs to be displaced by 2022 according to report from World Economic Forum (WEF) called The Future of Jobs Report. This means that the growth of artificial intelligence could create 58 million net new jobs in the next few years The areas in which Al will have positive impact are, Demand will be increased for professional service talent, with an emphasis on communications, logic and creation and technical talent dealing with computer technologies. In arena of data technology, huge jobs will be created as Al-based solutions in any industry both need and generate massive amount of data. Data interpreter’s analytics and miners will be needed on massive scale to annotate this data to provide context in ambiguous situations. It will increase employment for professors and researchers who have the potential to train engineers who can become a pool of requisite manpower required in the era of Al. Al is now helping companies to generate more profit and scaling up of their businesses and as a result, they will require a global workforce which can generate huge employment opportunities According to estimates healthcare would be one of the biggest winner from Al where job opportunities could increase by nearly 1 million In the near future. Al powered healthcare will be available at a scale and on demand for everyone. Hence, the requirement for Al-assisted healthcare technician job will see an upward surge. The education industry is slowly shifting towards e-learning concept much as smart content, personalised learning and other data driven operations which depends heavily on Al. Hence, this industry will need to hire plenty of Al and machine learning experts. Apart from these, new jobs will be created in gaming industry, robotics and cyber security. To properly leverage the power of Al, we need to address the issue at the educational level as well as in business Education system needs to focus on training students in roles directly associated with working with Al, including programmers and data analysts. This requires more emphasis to be put on STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Also, subjects centered around buiding creative, social and emotional skills should be encouraged. Artificial intelligence is more productive than human workers for repetitive tasks, however, humans outperforms machines in jobs that requires relationship building and imagination. International Labour Organisation (ILO) in its 'Future of Work report suggested a universal entitlement to lifelong learning that enables people to skill, reskill and upskill. In addition, it calls for greater investment in the care, green and rural economies in the backdrop of fear of job losses due to artificial intelligence. There needs to be an immediate government intervention for the availability of qualified faculty and researchers, so that skills could be developed to harness the potential of Al in promoting job creation. It is time for a vision for a human centered agenda that is based on investing in people's capabilities, institutions of work and in decent and sustainable work. Artificial intelligence will change our world both inside and outside the workplace. Instead of focusing on fear surrounding automation, businesses and governments all ever need to embrace these new technologies to ensure that they implement the most effective Al systems to enhance and compliment human intelligence. In this way Al in medium and long run will produce better paying jobs and augment and develop the human resource of the country and the world.", 
    "Topic97": "Drones are rapidly growing in popularity and have broken through rigid traditional barriers in industries. Over the past few years, drones have become central to the functioning of various businesses and governmental organisations. From scanning an unreachable location or military base to surveillance of an area or multiple areas, drones are proving to be extremely beneficial. Drones are the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Remotely Piloted Aerial System (RPAS) controlled either by a pilot on the ground or with the help of technology. It may be as small as a radio-centred toy helicopter or as big as a global hawk. Drones are playing a significant role in fight against the coronavirus by supporting the activities undertaken by police, healthcare and municipal authorities in surveillance and lockdown enforcement, surveying and mapping, spraying disinfectants etc. The concept of drones may well date back to 1849, when Austria attacked Venice using unmanned ballons stuffed with explosives. Later in 1916, Great Britian developed the first pilotless winged aircraft, the Ruston Proctor Aerial Target. In 1935, the British developed 'Queen Bee', a radio-controlled target drone. Although originally built for military purposes, drones have seen rapid growth and advancements. Today this technology has evolved into different forms and used widely in defence, commercial aerial surveillance, journalism, crowd management, e-commerce and search and rescue operations. An unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts, the drone its..f and the control system. The nose of the unmanned aerial vehicle is where sensors and navigation systems are present. The rest of the body is light weight. Drones can be controlled by the remote control system or a ground cockpit. They are equipped with state of the art technology such as infrared cameras, GPS, on-board sensors, software controlled flight plans and laser. The build types of UAVS are-fixed wing, tilt wing, unmanned helicopter and multicopter. Non-military UAVs use the electric engine and internal combustion engine. For better functioning and control, some drones are provided with Radar pointing and Return home features Radar positioning displays current location when drone crosses the control range of remote control, the return he feature makes drones flyback to its takeoff point. The latest technology has an in built GPS enabled chip which is instrumental in finding drone's location. An Altimeter lets the drone know what altitude it is at. Drones can be classified on different basis. Based on usage, it can be Drones for Aerial Mapping, Drones for Photography and Drones for Surveillance etc. However, the best classification of drones can be made on the basis of aerial platforms Based on the type of aerial platform used there are 4 major types of drones. They are -Multi rotor drones, fixed wing drones, Single rotor helicopter drones and Fixed Wing Hybrid VTOL drones. Multi rotor drones are the most common types of drones which are used for common applications like aerial photography, aerial video surveillance etc. Fixed wing drones use 'wings' like normal airplanes and are ideal for long distance operations like mapping or surveillance. Single rotor drones look very similar to helicopters and has just one big sized rotor plug and a small sized rotor on the tail to control its heading Hybrid VTOL (Vertical Take-Off-and Landing) are hybrid versions of drones combining the benefits of Fixed wing models with that of Rotor bases models (hover). At present, the application areas of drones are limitless. The technology that was once designed to destroy is now being used for the betterment of mankind. From wildlife conservation to disease control, emergency responses, geographic mapping UAVs is used in multiple sectors. Drones are normally used in the situations where manned flight is considered too risky or difficult. A typical unmanned aircraft is made up of light componite materials to reduce weight and increase its manouverability. This composite material's strength allows military drones to cruise at extremely high altitudes thus proving very beneficial in a country's defence mechanism. Many defence forces use drones as aerial targets to combat training of human pilots and to check the security of the sensitive areas. Air surveillance of large areas is possible with low cost drones. The surveillance applications include livestock monitoring, wildfire mapping pipeline security, home security, road patrolling and anti-piracy. Some journalists have even used drones for gathering news and covering disasters such as typhoons, damages done by hurricanes, etc. Many police departments across the world have procured drones to maintain law and order. There are unarmed surveillance drones which are helpful to monitor the movements of armed groups in the region, and protect the civilian population more effectively. UAVs are very helpful in the search and rescue operations undertaken after the hurricanes and other natural calamities UAVs have been tested as airborne lifeguards, locating distressed swimmers using thermal cameras and dropping life preservers to swimmers. Drones have been successful in the documentation of animals such as counting the number of animals present in a reserve forest and combat poaching of endangered animals such as rhinoceros. Archaeologists have used drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. Small drones help researchers produce three-dimensional models of sites instead of the usual flat maps and in less time. In agriculture, drones are helping in sprouting and monitoring crops, they can help assess, prevent and correct crop damage throughout the season by routine monitoring and early detection. To solve the problem of food insecurity, drones are instrumental as it helps in cutting down of crop losses through early detection of plant diseases. However, these advantages generate three major risks, which are violating sovereignty, over-using the military option and making it more difficult to identify violations of constraints against targetting non-combats. Undoubtedly, drone technology is another example of the rapid technological development taking place in the world but looking at the safety and ethical concerns related to it, the regulatory authorities need to be stringent and lay down strict rules and regulations for the use of the unmanned vehicles and drone technology for different purposes. Another challenge is that small drones can easily be built even by novice using parts that are easily available. This causes serious risk to security and privacy of people. Drones can also be used to record or look inside restricted places also such as prisons, military bases. It can be used to look inside homes through windows. There is a serious threat to safety and privacy of people because of drones. Given the complex security challenges that India faces, the role of UAVs in providing critical intelligence will be a key enabler not only in fighting wars effectively but also in deterring cross-border terrorist attacks in India. UAV of Indian Armed forces are Nishant, Rustom, UAV Panchi and AURA. Nishant’ is a multi-mission unmanned aerial vehicle with day/night capability used for battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance, target tracking and localisation and artillery fire correction. 'Rustom' is a medium altitude long endurance unmanned combat air vehicle being developed by DRDO, 'UAV Panchi' is the wheeled version of unmanned aerial vehicle Nishant, capable of taking-off and landing by using small airstrips 'AURA' is stealth UCAV, capable of releasing missiles, bombs and precision-guided munitions. Although a number of countries are working individually or jointly to develop an advanced drone industry, currently the US Israel and China are the market leaders. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has been working for several years to establish a world leading drone ecosystem in India. Therefore, it was necessary to develop global standard drone regulations that would permit, with appropriate safeguards, the commercial application of various drone technologies. According to the new regulations, there is need to obtain a Unique Identification Number (UIN), which is an equivalent of a number plate for all drones except drones in the Nano category. There is also need of an Unmanned Aerial Operator Permit (UAOP) or Remote Pilot license costing about 25,000 if you are operating above 200 feet. The drone will require an insurance cover, which should be of an adequate amount to cover risks, damages or other factors that are posed by operation. All drones will need to be NPNT compliant (No Permission No Take off), a software program to enable operators to obtain permissions prior to flying under these guidelines Air space has also been partitioned into Red Zone or 'No-fly Zone'. Yellow zone and Green Zone, Drones are proving to be extremely beneficial in places where men cannot reach or is unable to perform in timely and efficient manner. But they are still in infancy stage and hence require improvement. Drones fly at low speed in comparison to manned aircraft. Hence, there is need to enhance its speed. Drones are vulnerable to hackers and hence there is need to make it full proof. Though its usage is confined to few areas or sectors but in near future, it is expected to advance in almost every sector. In this backdrop authorities need to focus on two important aspects, first, incentivising the industries to adopt and develop the drone technology which will enhance their productivity and second regulating in such manner to address some of the challenges such as invasion of privacy and unauthorised surveillance. At global level, there is need of an international control regime on the proliferation and of armed drones. Drone technology is constantly evolving, so future drone tech is currently undergoing ground breaking progressive improvements. The advantages offered by use of drones are numerous. Throughout the world, innovators and scientific researchers are coming together to find innovative ways to use drones to fight COVID-19. In such critical times, policy makers world over are leveraging the advantages of drones and facilitating their wider deployment by removing barriers and reamlining their use. Over the period of time, drone technologies continue to evolve and grow as well as drones will become safer and more dependable.", 
    "Topic98": "Environmental pollution is the addition of contaminants into the natural environment that causes detrimental effects to nature, natural resources and mankind Any unnatural and negative changes in all the dimensions like chemical physical and biological characteristics of any component of the ecosystem i.e. air, water or soil which can cause harmful effects on various forms of life and property is called environmental pollution. Environmental pollution has existed for centuries Bot evidence suggests that, since the industrial revolution, contaminants in atmosphere have been growing day by day and resulting in severe damage to Earth Hazardous waste, toxic chemicals, suspended particles are affecting both humans and animals Many of the toxic chemicals and plastic have found their way in ecological food chain Environmental pollution is a primary reason for the rise of global warming and many incurable diseases. Before studying about different types of pollution, we have to understand the meaning of pollutants. Pollutants are the contaminants that get introduced into the natural environment, beyond permitted limits and caused undesired effects or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource. They can be classified into primary and secondary pollutants The primary pollutant such as Carbon Monoxide (CO) and plastic remain in form in which they were added to the environment. Secondary pollutants are formed due to interaction of primary pollutants amongst themselves, one is example of secondary pollutants which is formed when Hydrocarbons (HC) and Nitrogen Oxides (NO,) combine in presence of sunlight. On the basis of origin, pollutants can be anthropogenic (human-made) or natural Burning of fossil fuels, sewage etc can cause anthropogenic pollution, whereas volcanic dust, photochemically formed ozone is example of natural sources of pollutants On the basis of degradability, pollutants can be biodegradable or non-biodegradable Biodegradable pollutant such as paper products, vegetables etc. are broken down naturally by micro-organisms and are not harmful to environment. Non-biodegradable pollutants such as polythene, plastics, etc, cannot be broken down into smaller, harmles or simpler substances. Pollution happens in different forms such as air, water, soil, radioactive, light, noise and heat. There are different kinds of pollution and each of them has their sources and causes associated with them. Depending on the nature of pollutants and also subsequent pollution of environmental components, the pollution can be categorized as Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Soil Pollution, Noise Pollution and Radioactive Pollution. Air pollution takes place when damaging stuff including particulate matter and biological molecules are dumped into Earth's atmosphere. It can result from both human and natural actions. Natural events that pollute the air includes forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, evaporation of organic compounds and natural radioactivity. Man-made sources are mostly related to burning different lands of fuel which are chiefly oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen. Exhausting fumes from vehicles, natural gas, the burning of fossil fuels, nuclear accidents, destructive off gassing from things such as paint, plastic production and so on can cause pollution. Out of various kinds of pollution, air pollution is the major contributor to global warming. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide particles in the air can create acid rain when they mix with water and oxygen in the atmosphere Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases such as hydrofluorocarbons are major greenhouse gases emitted by natural and artificial sources. In humans, the short term effects, which are temporary, include illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis. They also include discomfort such as irritation to nose, throat, eyes and skin. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases such as emphysema In India, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) has been launched to tackle air pollution at the national level aiming for a 20-30 per cent reduction in PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentration by 2024. Introduction of cleaner fuels, promotion of mass urban transport networks and stricter regulatory standards such as BS VI are other significant steps. Under Green India Mission, massive afforestation is carried out to tackle air pollution. Water pollution is any contamination of water with chemicals or other hazardous substances that are detrimental to human, animal or plant health. For example, releasing inadequately treated waste water into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Many of these pollutants sink to the ocean's depths or float far distances from original source, where they are consumed by small marine organisms and introduced into the global food chain. Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as storm drain, waste water treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural run-off. Oil discharge into the surface of sea by way of accident or leakage pollute sea water to great extent in addition to plastic waste.

Water pollution is any contamination of water with chemicals or other hazardous stances that are detrimental to human, animal or plant health. For example, leasing inadequately treated waste water into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Many of these pollutants sink to the ocean's depths or float far distances from original source, where they are consumed by all marine organisms and introduced into the global food chain. Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as storm drain, waste water treatment plant or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as cultural run-off. Oil discharge into the surface of sea by way of accident or elage pollute sea water to great extent in addition to plastic waste. Water pollution can result in human health problems, poisoned wildlife and long can term ecosystem damage. When agricultural and industrial runoff floods waterways with excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, these nutrients often fuel algae blooms that then create dead zones where fish and other aquatic life no longer thrive. High levels of nitrates in water from nutrient pollution can also particularly harmful to infants, interfering with their ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and potentially causing 'blue baby syndrome'. Globally at least 2 billion people drink water that is contaminated, according to WHO and that may transmit dangerous diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Two important legislation, Water Pollution Act (1974) and Environment Protection Act regulates and controls the effluent discharged into the water. Pollution Control Boards at the central and state levels are empowered to prevent, control and abate water pollution. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has established a network of monitoring stations on aquatic resources across the country. Under Gange programme, sewage treatment plants are installed to control the point sources of population. At global level, the London Protocol went into effect in 2006. Under the London Protocol, dumping of all wastes and other materials is prohibited except for shortlist of items, like left over materials from dredging. Soil pollution is defined as the build-up in soils of persistent toxic compounds, chemicals, salts, radioactive materials or disease causing agent which have adverse effects on plant growth and animal health. The major contributory factors of soil pollution include use of chemical fertilizers in agricultural practices, acid rain, discharge of untreated sewage, leaching of waste from landfills and burning of crops after harvesting, Deforestation and soil erosion also plays important role in soil pollution. Excess heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury in soil can impair plant metabolism and decrease crop productivity, ultimately putting pressure on arable land. When they enter the food chain, these pollutants also pose risks to food security, water resources, rural livelihoods and human health. To contain soil pollution, the government has launched schemes such as Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP) and Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) Under Bonn challenge, India had committed toward restoring 13 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by year 2020 and a additional 8 million hectares by 2030. Under Soil Health Card Scheme, Soil Cards are issued to farmers which carry crop-wise recommendations of nutrients and fertilizers. Further, bio-fertilizers and manures are promoted by authorities. Noise pollution also known as sound pollution is propagation of noise with harmful impact on the activity of human or animal life. The sources of outdoor noise worldwide are mainly caused by machines, transport and propagation system It has now become very common due to dense urbanisation and industrialisation. Noise pollution can bring about adverse effects such as hearing loss, sleeping disorders, hypertensions and communication problem. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in associations with its counterparts monitors and regulates noise pollution under National Ambient Noise Monitoring Programme (NANMP). Radioactive pollution occurs when there is presence of radioactive materials in the environment, especially where their presence is accidental and when it presents an environment threat due to radioactive decay. Fukushima and Chernobyl incidents are among prominent example of devastation caused by radioactive pollution. Causes of radioactive pollution includes nuclear accidents from nuclear energy generation plants, use of nuclear weapons, use of radio isotopes for medical purposes, mining, cosmic rays and radioactive decay of waste products. Cancer is the most dominant radiation related disease apart from leukemia, anemia and hemorrhage. It is also responsible for genetic mutation in animals and plants. We can prevent the radioactive pollution in the following manner: By totally stopping leakages of radioactive materials from nuclear reactors industries and laboratories. By taking preventive measures so that natural radiation level does not rise above the permissible limit. By changing the radioactive waste disposal into harmless form or storing it in safe places. We can tackle the environmental pollution by taking following measures; Preserve the physical, chemical and biological integrities of the ecosystem with maximum protection of public health and the environment. Follow the three 'R's (Reduce, Reuse and Recyle) to conserve natural resources and landfill space Volunteer for cleanups in your community. One can get involved in protecting. One can help others understand the importance and value of our natural resources. Support environmentally sound policies that reduce energy growth rates. Emphasise energy conservation and encourage the use of renewable resources. Support measures to reduce pollution in order to protect surface water. Groundwater and drinking water Promote policies to reduce the generation and promote the reuse and recycling of solid and hazardous waste. Do not discharge chemicals into the waterways and choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and public places. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag. Human beings often forget that we are largely dependent on Mother Nature and become individuals to a very large extent determine the quality of life for everyone. This very well impact the Earth's sustainability. Decisions and actions taken by ignorant towards taking care of it. One has to see that one's actions can necessitates that individuals should not only be aware of various environmental sues and the consequences of their actions on the environment, but should also take a firm resolve to develop environmentally ethical lifestyles.

    "Topic99": "Forests are the important part of all living creatures on the Earth. A forest is F defined as a large area of land covered with trees or other types of vegetation cover. These are huge source of oxygen and have direct and indirect impact on our ecosystem. Forests cover almost 31% of the world's total land area. But nowadays, humans are destroying this precious forest cover at a large scale. This widespread destruction of forests is termed as deforestation. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has defined deforestation as ‘the conversion of forest to another land use or the long-term reduction of tree canopy cover below the 10% threshold’ In other words, deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests in order to make land available for other uses. There are a number of causes of deforestation for which human activities are greatly responsible. Some of the major causes are given below, Agriculture According to a report by UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), agriculture is one of the primary cause of deforestation. This can be linked to increasing population and shrinking space available for humans. Among different types of agriculture, subsistence agriculture (farming for own consumption) is responsible for 48% of forest destruction; commercial agriculture is responsible for 32% of deforestation and logging is responsible for 14% of degradation. According to a report by Food and Agricultural Organisation, almost 50% of forests in tropical regions have been cleared. This is majorly done by Tribal communities which are involved in subsistence farming. This type of agriculture is technically called slash and burn agriculture or shifting cultivation. The tribals fell the trees and burn than to clear the area for agriculture. They move from one area to other in search of more fertile piece of land thus giving rise to shifting cultivation. Urbanisation and Industrialisation Deforestation is also caused by the rapid rate of urbanisation and industrialisation. This can also be attributed to the rising population globally. Large areas of dense forests are cut down to clear spaces for urban development and setting up industries. This results in loss of forest cover. In 2015, Government of India passed the Compensatory Afforestation Bill to manage funds which were allocated for diverting forest land for non-forest purposes. Another major cause of deforestation is the economic significance attached with forest products Trees like Sal, Teak, Sheesham etc provide valuable timber. Forest woods are used mainly for construction purpose, furniture industry, s print and stationery etc. sports equipments etc. Cutting down forest for NEWS commercial use in different industries is a lucrative business. It is a very destructive human activity which destroys a large area of forest cover. It also causes many environmental impacts like erosion, formation of sinkholes, loss of biodiversity and contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes. Large number of forests is cleared every year for the purpose of mining mineral resources. With the rise in population, there is greater need for land. To meet the demands of food and housing forests are cleared indiscriminately. Land cleared for agriculture and settlements is the biggest cause of depleting forest cover all over the world. There are many effects of deforestation which directly and indirectly affects us. Some of the effects of deforestation are given below the most adverse effect of deforestation is global warming and climate change. Plants absorb Carbon Dioxide (CO) from the atmosphere and use it to produce food. In return it gives off oxygen. Destroying the forest means CO, will remain in the atmosphere and in addition, destroyed vegetation will give off more CO, stored in them as they decompose. This will alter the climate of that region. Another effect of deforestation on the biosphere is on water cycle. Reduced vegetation cover leads to loss of water from the ground and reduced evapotranspiration. Without tree cover, water does not get absorbed by the soil. This leads to depletion of ground water and less moisture in the atmosphere. The precipitation in turn gets affected leading to a skewed water cycle. Also, oceans work as carbon sink as carbon dioxide readily dissolves in water and pets concentrated in oceans Due to less forest cover, the acidification of oceans may take place leading to disturbance in the ocean ecology. Soil is also affected as a result of deforestation. The surface runoff of water leads to removal of the top fertile layer of soil. This happens when soil is without the protective layer of vegetation on it. The rate of erosion increases in a deforested area and results into soil degradation. In mountainous areas where the soil is loosely packed it gets affected which can lead to risk of landslide. Desertification increases as sands spread to nearby areas that are without any tree cover. Deforestation also affects the biodiversity as a whole. The loss of vegetation leads to extinction of species which are reliant on forest cover. As deforestation leads to destruction of animals' habitats, wild animals start trespassing human habitats, thus, get brutally killed by humans. Zoonotic diseases are also caused due to deforestation. Gadgil Report on Western Ghats has restricted human activities in certain areas Western Ghats is one of the biological hotspots of the world. Its conservation has been supported by UNESCO for preserving rich biodiversity. Forests are important in many ways. We depend on forests for our survival and our dependence on forest is due to their various usage. Some of the advantages of forest are as follows, Forest provide oxygen to all living beings and also consume carbon dioxide, thus maintaining the delicate balance in nature. They also help in preventing global warming. They control the climate and purify the atmosphere. They provide shelter to both tribal people and wild animals. They provide forests produce for human consumption and also for industrial uses thereby sustaining the economy in a big way. They also contribute to GDP and also a large number of people depend on them for their employment Thus, forests are important to conserve. Forests prevent soil erosion. They reduce floods and rapid runoff of water by binding the soils intact with their roots. They help to maintain the ecological balance and provide water, food and various other products. To increase the tree and the forest cover in our country and to deal with the rising menace of deforestation, the government has introduced several initiatives. Some of the initiaties taken by the government are as follows, The Indian Government introduced the Indian Forest Act, 1927. It defines the procedures for declaring an area of a reserved forest, a protected forest or a village forest by the State Governments. Reserved forests are those where hunting, grazing and felling of trees are banned. In protected forests, these activities are regulated and permitted with some restrictions.  Establishment of the National Forest Policy in 1952 was also one of the major initiatives by the Indian Government to ensure compensatory afforestation, sustainable utilisation, maintenance. Forest Conservation Act was passed in 1980 (with an amendment in 1988) by the Central Government. The main aim of this act was to conserve the forests and to look into the matters connected therewith. The Ministry of Environment and Forests constituted the National Afforestation and Ecodevelopment Board (NAEB) in 1992. It evolved specific schemes for promoting afforestation and management strategies through participatory planning. In 2009, Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) was constituted by the Central Government to channelise money towards compensatory afforestation. Other initiatives include Joint Forest Management (JFM), Social Forestry and National Bamboo Mission and so on. Besides these, the Indian Government has also established the Forest Survey of India, an organisation under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The survey publishes the biennial State of Forest Report'. According to the latest report of 2019, India has a policy of keeping one-third of country's area under forest. At present, Indian forest cover is 21.67% Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover in India followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. The mangrove cover has also increased in Indian coasts. Still the forest cover of India is much below the set criterion given by the Forest Policy of India. The forest dwellers like tribals are dependent on minor forest produce. Therefore, in 2006, the Schedule Tribe and other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act was passed to secure their right over forest resources. Recently, Central Government has published the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification 2020 which provides for scientific estimate of the likely impacts of a project such as mines, irrigation, dams, industrial units or waste treatment plant. Besides the Government initiatives, the participation of people and local communities is essential to conserve forests resources. There are number of socio-ecological movements that practised the Gandhian methodology of Satyagraha and non-violent resistance, through the act of hugging trees to protect them from falling. In 1970s, Chipko Movement started in Uttarakhand, in India. Due to state policy, forest cover in this area was reducing and the benefit was getting accrued to industrialists. Under the leadership of Chandi Prasad Bhatt and Sunderlal Bahuguna, the Chipko Movement took off. Due to their efforts large swathes of forest cover was secured from deforestation. On the similar lines, Apiko Movement was launched in 1983, by the villagers of the district of Karnataka province by hugging the trees in Kalase forest to save their forest areas. Another such movement was 'Silent Valley Movement' which was started in 1973 by an NGO led by school teachers and the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP). It aimed to save the silent valley from being flooded by a hydroelectric project in the Palakkad district of Kerala. Despite many governmental efforts, social initiatives, the analysis need to be done in order to put an end to the menace of deforestation. Participatory efforts on the part of community need to be initiated. Forests are an important part of our ecology. For sustainability and preserving the biodiversity of the Earth, deforestation should be checked. Human greed leads to misbalance in nature and in extreme cases may raise a question on their own sustenance. It is therefore imperative that we make sustained efforts to secure forest cover."
